Focusing on the role of the piano and related keyboard instruments in Western art (\"classical\") music, the course is structured as a series of units, each focusing on the work of a single composer and developing frameworks\u2014both musical and historical\u2014for appreciating it. The primary goal of this class is to help students become conversant with a broad repertoire of music, and to listen critically to performances of this music. Readings and homework assignments will be assigned with the goal of guiding this listening. Assessments include two listening exams, a concert report, and a presentation. This course is open to all students; no prior musical training is required.",

Guided in part by readings such as Oliver Sacks's Awakenings and Daniel Levitin's This Is Your Brain On Music, we will consider a wide range of historical and contemporary case studies, such as the impact of Tibetan singing bowls on stress levels, the relationship between 'New Age' music and meditation since the 1970s, and the use of music therapy interventions for hospital patients requiring high levels of care. Our work will be informed by readings and media from a diversity of subject areas, including cultural anthropology, neurology, sociology, music education, musicology, and music therapy. This course will make no assumptions about the topic; students will instead be required to explore and reflect on their own knowledge of sound, music, and healing through lively discussions, careful reading and writing, regular journaling, and thoughtful listening. No prior musical experience is required; curiosity and an open mind are encouraged.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course will focus on various intersections of music and religion in the Western tradition (although certain non-Western examples will be considered by way of comparison and contrast).   The most obvious such intersection is that of musical settings of liturgical texts, typically, though not necessarily, resulting in music which is actually part of a worship service. But music hardly needs to set liturgical texts in order to take on religious meanings and associations.   Many sacred texts are not liturgical at all, much music perceived as religiously meaningful is purely instrumental, and the rituals of concert-going and composer-adulating, as these have developed over the last two centuries, have often been compared to those of worship services.   The topics we cover will be considered in the light of aesthetic theories put forward as to the relations between aesthetics, theology, and beauty.The first half of the course will get under way through an examination of the many and varied musical references contained in the Bible.   This will be followed by a critical examination of the two principal approaches to sacred music which have long been held up as the models most worthy of emulation: a cappella-style of vocal polyphony of the mature Renaissance in Roman Catholic lands, and medieval (\"Gregorian\") chant, which experienced a noteworthy revival of interest in the Romantic period.   We will also explore the flip side of these models, i. e. the long history of condemnation of religious music perceived as falling short of the appropriate stylistic criteria.  Music growing out of the various strains of the Protestant Reformation (such as the chorales of Martin Luther, the French psalm-settings of Claude Goudimel, and the choral works and passions of Heinrich Sch\u00fctz and Johann Sebastian Bach), will be considered in terms of its embodiment of the ideals of that movement.    Highly varied approaches to Jewish music (synagogal cantillation, the Chasidic \"niggun,\" and the controversy over the use of organ in worship services) will complete this part of the course.The second half of the course will focus on representative compositions seen as vehicles of religious meaning (whether \"sacred\" music or not, and whether the composers and audiences in question are \"religious\" or not).  Some will be chosen among the numerous prayer scenes contained in operas both secular (Verdi's La forza del Destino) and religious (Poulenc's Dialogues of the Carmelites) in nature.  Choral examples may include Haydn's Creation, Bach's St. John Passion and St. Matthew Passion, Mozart's Vesperae Solenne de Confessore and his Requiem Mass, Beethoven's Missa Solemnis, Mendelssohn's Elijah, Requiem masses by Verdi and Faur\u00e9, Brahms' Ein deutsches Requiem, Mahler's Symphony #2; mystically-inspired music by modernists such as Schoenberg, Krenek, Webern, and Messiaen as well as  recent \"holy minimalists\" like Tavener and P\u00e4rt and composers inspired by the sacred traditions of the East (Holst, Cage, Lieberson, Harrison), and the phenomenon of religious pop songs.",

Among other issues, we will consider how the librettos were adapted from previously existing dramatic or literary works; the \"double aria\" and other formal conventions of 19th-century Italian opera; vocal embellishments, government censorship of Verdi's operas, controversies regarding \"original language\" and other issues of performance practice; the disposizioni sceniche and their implications for the staging of Verdi's operas; the relations between Verdi and his librettists, publishers, singers, and impresarios; the impact of Verdi's political views and personal life on his works; the dramatic and musical depiction of race and religion; and the presentation of race and ethnicity in such works as Un ballo in Maschera, Aida, and Otello.",

We will begin with ideas of the senses, proceed to aesthetics and methodologies for analyzing works created for the senses of sight and hearing, and spend most of the course considering specific case studies in which music borrows from visual domains, visual works that evoke the sense of hearing, and multi-media creations that involve both sound and imagery.",

The final project will involve expanding one or more earlier assignments into a larger piece.Students of any background are welcome, and no prior knowledge of composition or music theory is required. However, students will be required to perform or otherwise realize their composition assignments in class, so proficiency on a musical instrument, DAW, or notation software is encouraged. Students should come to class with an open mind, ready to share their work and offer constructive feedback for their peers.",

We will start by asking questions\u2014with the understanding that there may be no definitive answers, but instead an infinite series of provisional answers (that raise more questions)\u2014and in the course of formulating those answers, circumnavigate and bring a clearer focus on the nature of sound.What is noise? How does one define what makes something noise? What is it that make/s sound/s noise? What is it that make/s sound/s music? What is the relationship between noise and music? Are humans the only hearing organisms that experience noise? Are humans the only hearing organisms that experience music?",

This complexity of historical process and multiplicity of compositional techniques is obliterated by the uniformity of analytical method (pitch-class set theory) that dominates the field of post-tonal analysis today. The course will not be a systematic presentation of this method, but a series of glimpses into compositional techniques developed by some of the most prominent twentieth-century composers, and it will teach you how to use concepts derived from these techniques in analysis of their music. This twofold\u2014theoretical and analytical\u2014orientation will be reflected in the course design, in which discussion of concepts will be followed by analytical exercises. The assessment will include preparation for and participation in the discussion, and two analytical papers.The course will be of particular interest for students in music theory and composition, and it will appeal to some students in music performance, conducting, and musicology.",

    "ClassOverview": "Theory of melody emerged in the eighteenth century to supplement theories of counterpoint and harmony in the training of young composers. Launched by Johann Mattheson and further developed by Joseph Riepel, Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurg, Johann Philipp Kirnberger, and Heinrich Christoph Koch, this theory was guided by the metaphor of music as language. This is why composition handbooks of the era are full of concepts derived from grammar and rhetoric. Starting with these concepts and following the most authoritative composition handbook by Heinrich Christoph Koch, the course will guide you step-by-step from smallest musical building blocks up to entire compositions, and it will teach you how to apply concepts developed by eighteenth-century music theorists in analyses of pieces by Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven. Your skills developed in class will be tested in two quizzes and two analytical papers related to Haydn's string quartets and Mozart's symphonies.The course will appeal to students in music theory as well as performance, musicology, music education, conducting and composition.",

Increasingly law graduates are expected to know how to lead at the start of their career. This course will introduce and train students on critical leadership competencies necessary for personal fulfillment and professional success.The aim of the course is to develop whole-lawyers: lawyers who are equipped with the necessary intellectual and technical skills to succeed and the intra- and interpersonal skills necessary to lead, and reach high levels of happiness in their career.The course is grounded in Emotional Intelligence (EI), which accounts for more of the variance in successful leadership than IQ and technical legal skills.  The course provides an overview of EI and recent research in mindfulness, happiness, positive psychology, resilience, teamwork, empathy, and neuroscience, as well as insights on practical application of these skills to lawyering and leadership success.",

The hope is not to necessarily become great artists, but rather learn to quickly and effectively communicate ideas with others. We are going to design things that are disruptive and imaginative in an effort to create the future, and in order to do so, we have to be able to help others see what we see.We will explore the process of generative ideation as fueled by design sketching as well as presentation methods for communicating design concepts effectively. We will focus on user experience, human emotion, form and the use of materials in design and develop multiple concepts across a range of industries. We will also imagine and develop ideas at a range of scales, from handheld products, to large architectural installations. We will also work to develop your unique sketching style and aesthetic.We will work in a studio culture involving a fast-paced work environment, peer-review, and an opportunity to learn from a wide variety of resources. Reading and exercises will be provided on a project-by-project basis and you will also be encouraged to explore other types of visual communication that you find interesting in the development of concepts.",

The projects require a mix of skill sets from within and outside of engineering, and more importantly, a well-integrated team where everyone brings expertise from your own field of study to build on and share. These projects can become significant pieces in your portfolio, allowing you to demonstrate how you apply your discipline in the context of design, how you tackle a complex problem, how you work on an interdisciplinary team, and how you communicate professionally across diverse audiences and for different purposes. Enrollment is restricted to junior and senior level, and instructor consent is required. Students must have completed either DSGN 106-1 or DSGN 208, and it is recommended that you have completed at least two design projects.",

The only drawings by Leonardo that were published during his lifetime were illustrations for a textbook on geometry. The artist's final journal entry, written only days before his death, included attempts at a geometric proof.  A friend of the artist once lamented in a letter, \"He devotes much of his time to geometry, and has no fondness at all for the paintbrush.\"  What compelled Leonardo's fascination with this subject?  In this interdisciplinary class, we will explore Leonardo's geometric studies, using them as a vehicle for our own studies of artistic and industrial processes. Students will collaborate with artists, manufacturers, and technologists to produce sculptural objects in a range of materials. The course will culminate in a public iron pour in which we will attempt to translate several of Leonardo's sketches into cast-iron 3D pieces using a historical furnace in honor of the artist's work.",

Embedded microcontrollers are relevant for our annual robot design competition, NU engineering teams (Solar car, Baja), internships, and experimental apparatuses.  Our approach to coding emphasizes algorithm creation, debugging, methodical creation and partitioning in a modern notebook framework, as well as hardware-level access for microcontroller applications.

Unlike ME 241 where the subject of fluid mechanics was developed by \"synthesis\" starting from elementary ideas on the nature of fluids, this course takes as its starting point the fundamental equations of fluid flow and proceeds by way of \"analysis\" to explore its myriad consequences and applications.These areas are laid out as broad swaths of contiguous \"territories\": viscous flows, inviscid flows, \"almost\" inviscid flows (boundary layer theory), compressible flows and so on. As we travel through this \"landscape\", theoretical principles are applied to a wide variety of practical problems.In ME 241 (a prerequisite for this course) the concept of a fluid and its properties was introduced. The subject was then developed by a method of \"synthesis\" by systematically applying Newton's laws to fluid elements culminating in the fundamental equations of fluid flow \u2014 the Euler system of equations (if the fluid is inviscid) or the Navier-Stokes equations in the case of viscous flows. In this course we follow a complementary approach. After giving a brief review of the fundamental equations of fluid flow, we use the method of \"analysis\" to unravel the physical content of these equations.

Most engineers work on some sort of product development, whether it be creating new products or making better products, all based on a fairly well-defined design process. In ME 398, student teams create a new product for an outside client using this design process. Undergraduates take this course in their fourth year, after having mastered many of the engineering tools that they will use in their careers. Mechanical engineering students are required to take either this course or ME 340-2 to fulfill their design requirement. Two former students in this course went on to win the iF Product Design Award in an international design competition based in Germany for their design of the Swingline Worx Mini Stapler in 2000.",

We will explore perspectives about policing in Evanston and Chicago in the era of Black Lives Matter, building our expertise through rigorous reporting and thoughtful interviews with players on all sides of this enduring debate. The historical record is central to the equation, as is politics, especially with Evanston becoming one of the first cities in the country to pursue reparations for past racism and Northwestern debating the role of campus police. Taught by Peter Slevin, a contributing writer for The New Yorker, this workshop that will start with questions, not answers.

More than 20 million Asians live in the U.S. and trace their roots to 19 groups in Asia. The Chicago region is home to an Asian American population that is ethnically, racially, culturally and economically diverse. South Asian businesses on Devon Avenue sell paratha and saris, and community centers support newly settled families. Shops in Chinatown on Cermak Road sell traditional herbal cures and non-profits focus on immigrant rights and health concerns. A volunteer-run school in the suburb of Des Plaines offers weekly Mandarin lessons to first, second and third generation Chinese-American families who hope their American-born children will stay connected to their roots. A Chicago improv troupe called Stir Friday Night, made up of up-and-coming Asian American comedians, has performed for more than 25 years.In this course, we will explore and produce stories of Asian Americans at a pivotal time in history. Asian American cultural, social and political influence is on the rise. Kamala Harris is the first Black and South Asian American candidate on a major party's presidential ticket. Last year, Minnesota native Sunisa Lee became the first Hmong American to participate in the Olympics and the became the first Asian American to win an all-around gymnastics gold medal. Still, while Marvel featured Shang Chi and K-Pop tops U.S. Billboard charts, anti-Asian rhetoric, discrimination and attacks rose. Asian Americans are confronting their own bias and racism, as well. We will study journalistic work that explore the complex histories of Asians who have settled in the United States since before this nation's founding, the discrimination people faced and the opportunities they pursued. We will hear from and about Asian American journalists, activists, artists and leaders.This class is for anyone who wants to better understand the role of media and journalists covering communities of color. We will explore issues of identity, race and ethnicity, nationality and class. We will learn to report in and about communities with sensitivity, address cultural and language differences and practice journalism of empathy. We produce stories in a variety of media.",

    "ClassOverview": "Stereotypes. Coded language. Unconscious bias. How do these concepts factor into the media search for truth?  How might they stand in the way of public understanding of social difference? Clearly, the media affect the way we see one another across social boundaries established by such characteristics as race, ethnicity, gender and sexuality. How do the perspectives formed by this \"mediated reality\" ultimately affect our decisions on public policy in such areas as political participation, equal rights and criminal justice? These and other considerations are central to professional journalism responsibility and enlightened public choice making. Without question, the media are vital to the effective operation of our democratic system by providing information that should be free of the kind of bias that can distort the public participation process.Through discussion of principles of media professionalism and ethics, and an examination of some of the hot topics featured in today's headlines, this course will set a framework for recognizing and analyzing media narrative framing, as well as the representation of traditionally marginalized groups within that narrative frame. Ultimately, we will develop a deeper appreciation of media responsibility.

Modern Israel plays an enormous role in Mideast politics and impacts millions of Americans. The struggle between Israelis and Palestinians and their relations with neighboring Arab nations are the focus of worldwide media coverage. It's one of the most challenging areas for journalists to navigate and cover\u2014and it has an outsized influence on the region.This class explores U.S. policies and the opposing narratives of the current conflict over the West Bank, Gaza and the future of Israel and Palestine themselves - and some extraordinary history, filled as it is with politics and passion, diplomacy and dislocation, holy land and unholy war.Israel/Palestine is a multi-cultural arena of divergent dreams and destinies. The class will examine political strife, peace efforts, archaeological finds, high-tech start-ups, Israeli settlers and Palestinian refugees, the threats on Israel's borders, the nations that compete for influence and Mediterranean food and culture, from Jerusalem to the West Bank, Ramallah to Tel Aviv.Travel Component: Israel ProgramStudents in this program will visit the ancient, walled Old City of Jerusalem and the high-tech, cosmopolitan city of Tel Aviv, the Palestinian-led areas of the West Bank and Israeli-Arab towns, and the Golan Heights towering above the border with Lebanon and Syria.The class will emphasize reporting, writing and multimedia. Selected students will report two pieces on the ground in Israel--one short written project and one large written project that includes multimedia.

It provides an opportunity to hear from African journalists working in one of the world's newest democracies and to compare and contrast their experience with the increasingly contested role of reporters in the U.S., the world's oldest constitutional republic. Both countries recently experienced constitutional crises provoked by the behavior of unconventional chief executives who considered the conventions of journalism an existential threat. In both places, Covid-19 hit hard, revealing weaknesses and patterns of discrimination in public health systems. Speaking directly with journalists, activists, publishers, producers and media executives, we'll explore the state of independent journalism in South Africa and take stock of startups particularly well-adapted to reporting on the content. We'll center our exploration on several key questions: What relevance does the governing party's promise to produce a \"nonracial,\" egalitarian, anti-sexist, and non-homophobic society on the southern tip of Africa have for social justice movements here? And what are current expectations about journalism's role in bolstering those values? Drawing from radio, television, print, and online sites, we'll zero in on ethical considerations for doing exemplary journalism across lines of nationality, class, culture, language, ethnicity, race, age, gender and other considerations.",

    "ClassOverview": "For generations, investigative reporting has proven to be one of the highest and most impactful forms of journalism. It sheds light on wrongdoing, exposes rampant incompetence and calls to account powerful people and institutions, from presidents to banks to schools. Over two quarters, you will focus on social justice reporting through a single investigation that touches on the lives of vulnerable people in the U.S. and, potentially, overseas. You will explore documents, interview powerbrokers and the constituents they are supposed to serve, probe critical data and trends, conduct on-the-ground reporting in the United States or abroad and ultimately produce a groundbreaking investigative story from the ground up. Consider your classmates team members and allies. Consider your instructor a collaborator, editor and guide. Investigative reporting is hard. Expect to confront roadblocks. But along the way, you will learn to think, research and write like an investigative reporter. If you are successful, your work could potentially make a difference in the lives of vulnerable people. The goal is to publish a significant investigation in a professional media outlet, such as the ProPublica. This is a two-quarter class based in Evanston in the winter and Washington, D.C. in the spring.

What are the best techniques to get people to feel comfortable opening up? How do we get to know people's stories? What are the ethical issues that arise in this kind of work?  We'll read the masters, from Studs Terkel to the Nobel Prize-winning Svetlana Alexievich to Anna Deavere Smith. We'll read excerpts of oral histories on ACT UP, on the women abused by Bill Cosby, on refugees, on our time under COVID.  We'll listen to radio including Joe Richman's Radio Diaries and StoryCorps. We'll watch films like Flee, the animated story of an Afghan refugee told in his own words. We'll come to appreciate the power of the human voice.This is a relatively new way of telling journalistic stories, and so we'll look at how journalists are experimenting with this form. We'll hopefully have some guest speakers, practitioners of this craft.Everyone will have the chance to work on an oral history project of their own, and there will be room for those with audio experience to do it as an audio piece.

More than 20 million Asians live in the U.S. and trace their roots to 19 groups in Asia. The Chicago region is home to an Asian American population that is ethnically, racially, culturally and economically diverse. South Asian businesses on Devon Avenue sell paratha and saris, and community centers support newly settled families. Shops in Chinatown on Cermak Road sell traditional herbal cures and non-profits focus on immigrant rights and health concerns. A volunteer-run school in the suburb of Des Plaines offers weekly Mandarin lessons to first, second and third generation Chinese-American families who hope their American-born children will stay connected to their roots. A Chicago improv troupe called Stir Friday Night, made up of up-and-coming Asian American comedians, has performed for more than 25 years.In this course, we will explore and produce stories of Asian Americans at a pivotal time in history. Asian American cultural, social and political influence is on the rise. Kamala Harris is the first Black and South Asian American candidate on a major party's presidential ticket. Last year, Minnesota native Sunisa Lee became the first Hmong American to participate in the Olympics and the became the first Asian American to win an all-around gymnastics gold medal. Still, while Marvel featured Shang Chi and K-Pop tops U.S. Billboard charts, anti-Asian rhetoric, discrimination and attacks rose. Asian Americans are confronting their own bias and racism, as well. We will study journalistic work that explore the complex histories of Asians who have settled in the United States since before this nation's founding, the discrimination people faced and the opportunities they pursued. We will hear from and about Asian American journalists, activists, artists and leaders.This class is for anyone who wants to better understand the role of media and journalists covering communities of color. We will explore issues of identity, race and ethnicity, nationality and class. We will learn to report in and about communities with sensitivity, address cultural and language differences and practice journalism of empathy. We produce stories in a variety of media.",

Even if you came to Medill thinking you'd like to specialize in one sport, there are multiple reasons why leaving yourself open to a variety of assignments will give you a broader perspective and flexibility that will serve you well in your job search. This course will examine how professionals become experts in a sport they have never covered or considered covering before. It will demonstrate how covering one sport can make you a more creative and effective writer and reporter in others. We will take an inter-disciplinary approach into the physiological, psychological and cultural aspects of various sports and their participants, as well as potential issues regarding gender, race, sexuality and mental health.",

From persistent inequalities in housing and education to gleaming edifices of financial success, these \"tale of two cities\" twins have much in common. South Africa has made progress since the fall of racial apartheid in 1994, but there is much work still to be done. The multiracial \"Rainbow Nation,\" is a young democracy with a constitution considered one of the most progressive in the world. But many of the rights promised have yet to be fulfilled for Johannesburg's 4.4 million people. These gaps provide ample material on which to report. The 2019 national election period was only the sixth time that blacks had been allowed to vote.Your trip will begin with briefings with experts, visits to the Apartheid Museum and other attractions, and tours - from the fashionable Sandton, \"Africa's richest square mile,\" to the famous Soweto, a key site in the struggle against apartheid.We will apply a \"solutions journalism\" lens to our reporting on the following tentative topics:* The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR)* Gender Based Violence* Experimental News Media Platforms* EducationIn this course, you will:* Develop a global view of the urbanization and human rights issues facing major cities.* Better understand, through the lens of South Africa, the forces shaping the developing continent, including technology, age, gender and immigration issues.* Learn interviewing and reporting strategies in a foreign country.* Produce a reporting project that, it is hoped, will be published after the trip",

How might they stand in the way of public understanding of social difference?  Clearly, the media affect the way we see one another across social boundaries established by such characteristics as race, ethnicity, gender and sexuality.  How do the perspectives formed by this \"mediated reality\" ultimately affect our decisions on public policy in such areas as political participation, equal rights and criminal justice?  These and other considerations are central to professional journalism responsibility and enlightened public choice making.  Without question, the media are vital to the effective operation of our democratic system by providing information that should be free of the kind of bias that can distort the public participation process.Through discussion of principles of media professionalism and ethics, and an examination of some of the hot topics featured in today's headlines, this course will set a framework for recognizing and analyzing media narrative framing, as well as the representation of traditionally marginalized groups within that narrative frame. Ultimately, we will develop a deeper appreciation of media responsibility. Just as important, we will expand our sense of media literacy in considering a path forward\u2014whether as professional journalists or engaged citizens\u2014as we navigate the challenging terrain of an increasingly diverse society, one in which we all can appreciate the value of social difference and multiple perspectives.",

The focus of the work produced in the class will be on visual, cultural stories, but the reporting will be deepened by readings, discussions and explorations of broader social issues, geopolitics and ethics. The central focus of the class will be non-fiction TV series focused on food and culture: The Anthony Bourdain series Parts Unknown, which aired on CNN for several seasons before Bourdain passed away in 2018; Street Food Latin America; and High on the Hog. These richly visual series are each uniquely creative and beautifully written, produced and edited. Students will emulate these series in their work, developing stories in advance with the help of facilitators in Argentina who will also accompany them on their reporting/shooting days. In addition to doing their own stories in pairs, students will have cultural excursions to get to know the city, meetings and visits with people and locations in the Buenos Aires episode of Parts Unknown and Street Food, and sessions to deepen students' knowledge of city, Argentina and Latin America. In this course, students will: Research, report and deepen their knowledge of global reporting, exploring a different and more creative way to present non-fiction documentary/news video/television. Broaden their journalistic view of the world through first-hand experience in video reporting. Learn to engage effectively and ethically with people in an unfamiliar community, culture and/or setting. Learn industry best practices with faculty, local producers and fixers, directors of photography and editors from the series.

    "ClassOverview": "The course discusses and explores environmental issues across US and the world linked to the consistent issues of Indigenous Peoples self-determination, autonomy, and sovereignty, as they are expressed in different constitutional frameworks across the North and Global South. From major confrontations over pipelines affecting Tribal Reservations mobilizing Indigenous people and their allies around the world, to battles over whaling rights and mining of tar sands, to sulfide mining adjacent to Tribal Reservations, to disputed land claims in the Northeast, and battles in the West over water, fracking, and grazing, the rights of Native governments and World Indigenous Peoples are intersected in the new century at the cultural, political, and legal core of our contemporary history.This course will prepare students to be able to understand and report about national and international environmental issues, such as air and water quality issues; mining; land tenure and uses of Indigenous traditional knowledge systems in agriculture and ecosystems conservation; infrastructure development; and territorial rights clashing with national and corporate expansion. The content has particular connections to First Nations in the Great Lakes region due to our geographical proximity and will also provide connections to corresponding national and international Indigenous environmental issues, and the responses and debates across science research, news, and international policy contexts. The seminar focuses too on how the media covers Indigenous environmental issues and how that coverage contributes to the formation of public opinion and public policy. The seminar provides the critical tools to analyze and report about current environmental struggles directly from US and World Indigenous Peoples voices, understanding the controversies within a cultural context, in order to make informed decisions and maintain a journalistic ethical integrity. The central case study of the seminar will be larger land rights issues, and the contradiction between development and sustainability. The case study of the travel that the course offers will be the impact of modernity and infrastructure development for Mayan Peoples in the Yucatan Peninsula, which will serve to expand the international scope on Indigenous environmental issues across the world.",

But along the way, you will learn to think, research and write like an investigative reporter. If you are successful, your work could potentially make a difference in the lives of vulnerable people. The goal is to publish a significant investigation in a professional media outlet, such as the ProPublica. You can read the published investigations of prior MIL classes here: https://mil.medill.northwestern.edu/",

In this course students will use investigative tools including FOIAs, public documents, data, court filings and more as we begin the investigation that will take place over winter and spring quarters. The early weeks of the course will focus on deep immersion in the specific topic that has been chosen and prepared by the instructor, organizing the investigation and strategizing about how to use different investigative methods. Then students will begin actually investigating and reporting, working as a team guided by the instructor. This course is required for participation in the spring-quarter Chicago Medill Investigative Program. The topic of the investigation will be a nationwide look at a mental health and criminal justice issue.",

    "ClassOverview": "A Chicago police officer fatally shoots a teenager, but police refuse to release dash-cam video until a journalist invokes the Illinois Freedom of Information Act. A lawsuit accusing the Chicago City Council of violating open meeting laws is filed after reporters learn of private discussions on the city's response to the Covid-19 pandemic. A journalist covering a protest over the death of George Floyd files a federal lawsuit accusing police of violating his First and Fourth Amendment rights for spraying him with a chemical agent. As these and other cases demonstrate, journalists in these contentious times need to turn to the law to confront increasing challenges to newsgathering and investigative reporting. This unique joint Practicum with Northwestern's Pritzker School of Law - comprised of externships and weekly seminars - aims to advance the public's access to information, to hold institutions accountable, and to defend free speech and press freedom.  Through externships of 10-12 hours a week at media organizations, non-profits, and press-advocacy groups (provided and matched by faculty), Medill students will learn how to research and prepare access requests and how to research legal or policy matters related to investigative and accountability issues. Through lectures and guest speakers, students will be introduced to the major transparency laws and other topics inherent in the relevant casework.  Working collaboratively with law students, Medill students will deepen their understanding of the subject matters, share their experiences on outside projects, and discuss the legal and ethical issues that arise.  Students will be matched with existing externships.",

Students will analyze investigative stories and daily coverage to gain a better understanding of the local government and people. We'll explore how journalists cover the halls of power, the neighborhoods of D.C. and critical issues of the day -- from policing to homelessness to the lack of adequate medical care. Working individually or in small teams throughout the quarter, students will ultimately drill down on a big city issue of significant public importance, identifying key stakeholders, documents and data that could be used to shape an impactful story about a vibrant city with a history of great successes and growing list of ongoing challenges.",

Russia's war in Ukraine (or the aftermath of it) will provide the framework for the class. However, students also will learn about energy and climate change in current and past bilateral and multilateral relations between the United States and its allies and foes, including China, the Middle East, Canada and Latin American. Student will also have guest lectures, including from experts in international climate change negotiations, particularly the United Nations climate change meetings, known as the Conferences of the Parties (COP).The centerpiece of the course will be a week-long trip to Germany as part of the Medill Explores program. Students will report on the energy and refugee crises in Europe caused by the war in Ukraine. Students will visit a fossil fuel project, an LNG terminal under construction to receive natural gas imports and help Europe wean off Russian fuel, and a renewable energy project, probably a wind farm. They'll investigate how Europe's plans to wean off fossil fuels and fight climate change have been altered by the Kremlin's military aggression. In Germany, students will interview average people about how their lives are harmed by these crises",

This course will explore the factors that make people vulnerable to misinformation and the reasons that corrections so often fail to change their minds.

    "ClassOverview": "This course has two objectives.  The first objective is to try to understand how and why \"democracy\" today has come to be regarded as the only \"legitimate\" form of government.  This was not always the case.  After a brief and dramatic appearance more than two thousand years ago in the ancient Greece, \"democracy\" was regarded more often negatively as a dangerous and unstable form of government susceptible excesses of both \"voice and violence.\" However, starting in the late eighteenth century in the aftermath of two great revolutions, the American and the French, followed by the end of the Second World War in 1945 and the end of the Cold War in 1991, democracy has had a series of spectacular ascents. Today democracy is seen as the only viable and legitimate form of \"self-governance\" and as an expression of \"popular sovereignty.\"   How did this happen?  The second objective is to examine the growing disenchantment with democracy in the very midst of its triumphal march.  The discontent with democratic governance is no longer confined to \"new democracies\" in poor or developing countries where they are often afflicted with massive corruption, demagogic leadership, and electoral violence and fraud.  Increasingly mature democracies in advanced countries in Europe and North America are also suffering from a legitimacy deficit due to issues related to economic inequality, a high rate of unemployment or chronic under-employment, immigration, racial and religious conflicts. This is evident from the resurgence of populism, especially authoritarian versions of populism, in recent decades in many parts of the world.  This, in turn, has given rise to growing chatter about the coming death of democracy.  In this course, we will primarily focus on the following question: How can these two seemingly contradictory claims about democracy- the reports about its impending death and need for its continuing existence for securing legitimacy to govern- plausibly coexist and have currency in political discourse and thinking today.",

The design of such systems, however, is not simply a technical question. In order to successfully create these systems, we need to understand how people work, play, and communicate with one another in a wide variety of situations. This course illustrates the practice of understanding human interactions that take place both with and through technology; and it explores the design, creation and evaluation of technologies to support such interactions. Course topics include: design processes, prototype construction and technology evaluation techniques. Specialized topics may include social software and collaborative systems, value-sensitive design, and agent-based technologies. No programming experience is necessary. There will be occasional labs to explain technical content. Course requirements include short hands-on exercises, two exams, and a group project.",

This course draws on theories from communication and psychology to dissect what message elements tend to make content \u2018sticky'\u2014the elusive quality of messages that seem more engaging, understandable, memorable, and shareable. We will discuss how these elements can be applied and how you can leverage them to more effectively change thoughts, attitudes, and behavior. The course and assignments are structured to help you think about the mechanisms associated with \u2018sticky' messages and complete a research paper where you dissect a message of your choosing.

We'll look for common themes in the discourse around certain events and practices, asking why certain ideas or tropes are used and repeated, and what historical, social, cultural, and political associations inform these tropes that help them to perpetuate racial stereotypes in popular culture without overtly claiming racism.

How do new technologies transform sensory experience at different moments in history? This course provides an introduction to the field of theoretical writings within the humanities addressing the nature of media and the role of technology in twentieth- and twenty-first century western cultures. The course will be divided roughly into two halves: one portion devoted to foundational texts (Benjamin, McLuhan, Haraway) and to key terms (media, mediation, cyborg, digital, networks, etc.); and a second portion attentive to more contemporary work. Throughout our task will be to grasp these texts on their own terms, to put them into conversation with other texts and contexts, and to trace their relation to other texts in media theory and beyond. Requirements will include a short presentation, a shorter paper, and a longer one.",

Occasionally we will do this through improvisation sessions and/or across the floor phrasing. This concentrated time at the beginning of class will develop our somatic awareness of our body in space and wake up the various pathways in the body. The remainder of the class will be spent refining these ideas through short or long movement phrases. We will spend at least a week to two weeks on each of these phrases to allow the body time to fully integrate and somatically comprehend the spatial pathways. As a facilitator, I am invested in cultivating a space of open conversation about somatic sensory experiences, as well as a space of experimenting with pathways that are effective to your unique anatomy. Cultivating a space that is creative, holistic, and connective.",

Indeed, human-beings are creatures who naturally think about the world in story elements and who rely on narrative structures in order to explain their surrounding world and the actions of those who inhabit that world. In various contexts, research has repeatedly demonstrated that engaging stories may be especially valuable as they facilitate processing of new, difficult, or controversial information, produce longer-lasting effects, and encourage adoption of story-consistent attitudes and behaviors. Informed by the media psychology perspective, this course will examine core texts, story factors, audience characteristics, and processes underlying narrative persuasion, as well as ongoing inconsistencies and debates. The questions posted by the literature and the current media landscape in many ways will set the agenda for this course.",

The faculty leader serves as coach and facilitator to guide students through a process that explores who they are (strengths, needs, values), reveals how others experience them (feedback), examines who they want to be (vision/purpose) and identifies actions for moving forward (development planning). Readings and individual reflective exercises will be completed as pre-work in advance of scheduled class sessions and explored through additional activities and discussion during class.  In addition, students will have the opportunity to meet individually with the faculty leader for further leadership coaching.This course meets for the last 5 weeks of the quarter - attendance at all five sessions is mandatory; maximum 16 seats in course - waitlist available.

    "ClassOverview": "When you talk about TV, what is the \"TV\" that you're talking about? Rather than television's content or programming, this course is about the materiality of TV, or the \"stuff\" that makes television possible. TV is and has many objects, and while we grow attached to some (e.g., the television set from your childhood home), many others remain resolutely hidden from us (e.g., the vast array of TV satellites still encircling the globe). In this course, we will examine television's objecthood from a variety of vantage points, including how TV is produced and the technical equipment used on-set, as well as how television is received, via an assortment of touchable screens in a range of physical places. We'll also consider the infrastructure necessary to reliably deliver television to you, including satellites, antennas, and cables, and deal with questions of ephemerality and nostalgia as related to TV by examining props, costumes, and other memorabilia. Taking our cue from the era of television's technological beginnings, when TV was more likely to be found in science laboratories than living rooms, a portion of each week's class will be devoted \"lab\" time. Here we will examine, first-hand, various television objects, from toys to user's manuals to museum exhibits. These hands-on endeavors will be supplemented by a variety of theoretical readings which will help us develop tools and techniques for analyzing TV objects. You will be assessed through short weekly reflections, or a \"TV diary\" in which you record your own encounters with television's various objects, and a larger research project, culminating in a final \"show-and-tell\" showcase.",

Throughout the course, we will bring so-called seminal films from around the globe in dialogue - and in fruitful collision - with contemporary and/or lesser-known works that challenge the so-called \"canon\" and resonate with related themes, philosophies, formal strategies, geographies, cultures, agendas, atmospheres, etc. We will place an emphasis on exploring the diverse possibilities of nonfiction films as well as on the politics and ethics of representation, particularly as they pertain to race, class, gender, sexuality, etc.  Screenings and readings will be intensive and rewarding for both graduate students and motivated undergrads, and we will invite several filmmakers to join us in discussion of their work. Students will be asked to write short response papers and produce either a final research paper or a final media arts project in conversation with films viewed in class. For Doc Media MFA students, this is a highly recommended class to fulfill the 1 credit history requirement.  Learning objectives for all include: to strengthen your understanding of a major strand in the weave of film history; to develop your strength and stamina as a film viewer; and to expand your awareness of the wide variety of social, political, cultural, aesthetic, and philosophical issues nonfiction filmmaking has wrestled with throughout its development.",

Looping time. Time that extends. Time that speeds up. Two time periods that are tracked simultaneously. Two times that slowly or quickly. Elliptical time. Ambiguous/unclear time. Our questions: How does the treatment of time reflect the story's theme and deepen the terrain being explored? Do such works still adhere to a four-act structure or hero's journey structure, even though that structure might be manipulated or hidden? Or does each work have a unique design that resists reference to more conventional screenplay structures? How do time experiments work differently in drama, comedy, or horror/science fiction? Is there a reason that more films/tv shows appear to be experimenting with time? Or have there always been such experiments? If 4-act and hero's journey structures are often criticized for being male/heterosexual, can other treatments of time offer paths to (better) representing different genders and sexual orientations? What are the challenges for a screenwriter in creating such a work? What might be the benefits be? What treatment of time hasn't been attempted that you might try in your screenplay or teleplay?We'll reference such works as Watchmen (TV), A Ghost Story, The Others, Groundhog Dog, Run Lola Run, Moonlight, Irreversible, Incendies, This is Us, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (and other Charlie Kaufman works), (500) Days of Summer, Arrival, Beforeigners, Russian Doll, Pulp Fiction (and other Tarantino works), Carol, Peppermint Candy, 12 Years a Slave, the Twilight Zone, Memento (and other Christopher Nolan works), True Detective, Looper, Back to the Future, Edge of Tomorrow, The OA, 2001, Sunset Boulevard, the Sweet Hereafter, Rashomon, and Parasite.

As part of this \"trouble\", an inescapable consequence of \"queerness\" is the tightrope in which queer bodies walk between the affirmation of being seen and the safety of going unnoticed. In this studio-based performance course, students will create work that explores both identity and visibility (or invisibility) within the context of performance art. Thinking through the work of performance pioneers like Adrian Piper and contemporary performance artists like Mark Aguhar and Patty Chang, students will utilize their body as a performative tool to infiltrate, invade, and make queer performance in unsuspecting spaces.Taking these actions \"into the streets\", students will be asked to embody and explore otherness through the execution of their work in public to reclaim space for themselves. As students explore how their presence, actions, and body can become a site of queer intervention, they will also learn strategies to capture these ephemeral moments through various media such as photography, video, and firsthand narrative accounts in order to present their work post performance.",

This class will explore contradictions such as these by placing discourses around childhood and children's media within their broader cultural, social, and historical contexts. We will discuss a wide range of media texts, including film adaptations of fairy tales and classic children's literature, children's television, digital games, children's music, and online video. These case studies will allow us to engage with debates about contemporary media culture and interrogate differing perspectives on the nature of childhood. Children are often understood to be a particularly vulnerable segment of the media audience, and the investigation of children's media has much to tell us about regimes of regulation and censorship, theories about media influence on behavior and identity, the relationship between media and the lived environment, and debates about the media's role in education and marketing. Our goal is to better understand children's media culture and the social institutions and practices that have shaped it, while engaging with this important cultural field through critical, historical, and aesthetic analysis.",

How do we talk about games in comparison with other media? How does one approach to talking about games differ from another?To augment its focus on theoretical and critical approaches to games, this course will make use of texts from a range of disciplines, including philosophy, critical theory, anthropology, and literature. Using these texts to enrich our gameplay and our readings about games, we will deepen our understanding of the language we use to discuss and design this century's breakout medium.This will be a reading-  and writing-heavy course: class meetings will consist of discussion of readings, and assignments will generally take the form of written responses and critical essays.

Readings will explore production, storytelling, identity and distribution of TV and web entertainment. Students will watch, analyze and have the option to pitch or produce television. The goal of this course is to give students a deeper understanding of the complexity and ever-changing nature of a media business. Television is arguably the country's most powerful medium, foundational to American culture and history in the post-WWII era. At first tightly regulated and controlled, television has fragmented, its networks folded into conglomerations and its programs spread across dozens of channels. Throughout the semester students are encouraged to question how changes in television production, regulation and distribution affects programming, culture and politics at large.",

Throughout the course, we will bring so-called seminal films from around the globe in dialogue - and in fruitful collision - with contemporary and/or lesser-known works that challenge the so-called \"canon\" and resonate with related themes, philosophies, formal strategies, geographies, cultures, agendas, atmospheres, etc. We will place an emphasis on exploring the diverse possibilities of nonfiction films as well as on the politics and ethics of representation, particularly as they pertain to race, class, gender, sexuality, etc.  Screenings and readings will be intensive and rewarding for both graduate students and motivated undergrads, and we will invite several filmmakers to join us in discussion of their work. Students will be asked to write short response papers and produce either a final research paper or a final media arts project in conversation with films viewed in class. For Doc Media MFA students, this is a highly recommended class to fulfill the 1 credit history requirement.  Learning objectives for all include: to strengthen your understanding of a major strand in the weave of film history; to develop your strength and stamina as a film viewer; and to expand your awareness of the wide variety of social, political, cultural, aesthetic, and philosophical issues nonfiction filmmaking has wrestled with throughout its development.",

We will read some of the prominent literature on the topic while maintaining a healthy skepticism about many of the claims and categories that are typically tossed around in discussions of media and nostalgia. In addition to readings on nostalgia, we will also look at writing that skirts and/or stretches the limits of nostalgia. We will eschew imputing nostalgia to media texts in ways that flatten them and their viewers into a homogeneous blob of banal sentiment. Instead, we wonder how and why certain kinds of cultural representations get categorized as \"nostalgic\"\u2014sometimes almost instantly\u2014and pay attention to who is making the claim, on behalf of whom, and in response to what kinds of texts. The aim is to allow nostalgia its potential radical due, its affective fragmentations and dispersion (beyond binary categorizations), even as the culture sometimes tries to wrap it up in neat packages with (many) academics and popular critics affirming these efforts; and we will admit that sometimes the culture knows that it's just peddling an image.Course readings will be available on Canvas.

    "ClassOverview": "In recent years, the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements have challenged how scholars approach moral questions surrounding the works, artists or genres they select for syllabi and public exhibitions. Yet as this crucial debate around the ethics of pedagogy has grown, there has been no robust discussion about how we treat these same works in research contexts. What does it mean to feel morally conflicted about picking a novel, theorist, film or image for a class, but less so when it comes to analyzing that same material in an article or talk? As scholars, do we want our object to be \"good\" too much?This is a class about what happens when good scholars study bad things, highlighting how this practice has always been a key part of critique. It is often by running up against critical thought that a media work becomes \"ethical\" or \"unethical\" in the first place. Moreover, the question of how to engage with \"unethical media\" motivates a whole array of critical argumentative comportments - it shows us how to canonize, how to excuse, how to elevate, how to politicize, how to aestheticize, how to love or hate - and in this way the question of ethics helps us to assume the identity of a scholar. To gain perspective on this process, our class will look at the intersection of contemporary theory and moral philosophy, along with films, photographs, graphic novels and radio dramas that try to deal morally with issues of aesthetic distance, visual violence, cancel culture, scholarly privilege, disgrace, eco-pessimism, and the ethical representation of sexuality, gender expression and race.Theorists may include: Chinua Achebe, Elizabeth Anscombe, Lauren Berlant, Judith Butler, Jacques Derrida, Georges Didi-Huberman, Immanuel Kant, Jos\u00e9 Esteban Mu\u00f1oz, Sianne Ngai, Susan Sontag, Judith Jarvis Thompson and Linda Williams.

We will not only look at plays, playwrights, and performances that have taken empire as their subject matter, but also at how imperial structures and legacies have shaped the production of British theatrical practice and its dissemination across the globe. Various questions will resurface throughout the course: - How has empire been represented - or obscured - in British playwriting? - How has British theatrical practice been exported and received around the world? - How has the British theatrical canon been reassessed and reclaimed in postcolonial spaces?Like all Theatre 140-2 courses, this class introduces students to university-level research paper writing that incorporates performance analysis and secondary sources.

We will seek answers to various questions: Can theatre and performance adequately address climate change? How does class, race, gender, and location influence the making of eco-art? What are the ethics of using animals on stage? What is Broadway's carbon footprint?In this course, you will engage theatrical \"texts,\" performance art, photography, painting, and sculpture to refine analytical skills that apply both to academic work and rehearsal rooms.

    "ClassOverview": "At its core, the artistic process of adaptation requires change, and yet anxiety about changing too much or diverging too far from the original source material continues to dominate critiques of new adaptations. So much so, it is nearly impossible to reach a consensus about when an adaptation drifts too far from its original and becomes something new altogether. In this class, we will move beyond the limited comparisons of the original-versus-copy, faithful-versus-loose by approaching theatrical adaptations not just as artistic products but also as complex processes of creation and reception. We will explore how multiple playwrights interpret the same source material in radically different ways and infuse their adaptations with unique points of view. We will also discuss how specific cultural and historical contexts influence audience reception, foregrounding different themes within the source material.This course is divided into three units: the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice from Ovid's Metamorphoses, Shakespeare's tragedy Othello, and Beckett's absurd tragicomedy Waiting for Godot. We will investigate how adaptations of these stories\u2014including Broadway's hit musical Hadestown, Paula Vogel's feminist parody Desdemona, and Antoinette Chinonye Nwandu's politically-charged Pass Over\u2014critique the original source material while simultaneously ensuring the sources remain cultural touchstones.

No single artist has exemplified this trend than Bertolt Brecht, arguably the single most influential playwright and theorist in modern theatre history. In this class, students will be introduced a range of global arts practices that came to be known as the \"progressive world theatre\" movement. Very often these diverse practices shared the work of Brecht as an artistic touchstone. Students should expect to become highly conversant in the Brechtian method, forms of analysis, and the global influence of his work through this class.",

We will also explore the work of artists, activists, and survivors in protests, truth and reconciliation commissions, and communal courts, as well as the influence of these different sites of performance on theatre. These performances from the stage and everyday life are embodied public events that engage multiple audiences, allowing people material ways to join in negotiating trauma and enacting personal and collective transformation.

As part of this \"trouble\", an inescapable consequence of \"queerness\" is the tightrope in which queer bodies walk between the affirmation of being seen and the safety of going unnoticed. In this studio-based performance course, students will create work that explores both identity and visibility (or invisibility) within the context of performance art. Thinking through the work of performance pioneers like Adrian Piper and contemporary performance artists like Mark Aguhar and Patty Chang, students will utilize their body as a performative tool to infiltrate, invade, and make queer performance in unsuspecting spaces.Taking these actions \"into the streets\", students will be asked to embody and explore otherness through the execution of their work in public to reclaim space for themselves. As students explore how their presence, actions, and body can become a site of queer intervention, they will also learn strategies to capture these ephemeral moments through various media such as photography, video, and firsthand narrative accounts in order to present their work post performance.",

The full draft will be read out loud in class and MFA and advanced undergraduate directing students will workshop and present scenes from the play. Students will serve as actors during the reading and workshopping of the play. Playwriting students will be expected to workshop a recent work. An older project may be workshopped if it has undergone significant revisions. This is the first part of a two part class. The second part is a production class which will run in the spring (likely Thursdays 11am-150pm). Four plays from part one of the class will be selected to receive workshop productions in part two. This will culminate in a weekend festival in June where the produced plays will be showcased.",

We will then examine organizations and specific cases of organizational change through several different analytic lenses. While applying these different analytic lenses, we will attend to change processes occurring at four different levels of analysis identified by scholars of organizational change: individual, group, organization, and institution.  We will also examine the ways in which different lenses shed light on particular levers or resources for organizational change. Throughout the course, students will be given opportunities to apply course constructs to particular cases of organizational change of interest to them.",

The coursework is intended to support you through readings, large-group discussions, and analyses that inform us about practitioner research and inquiry. The courses are also designed to support your research through smaller instructor research groups and other experts in assessment, who will provide more in-depth opportunities for discussion, analysis, and feedback as you continue your own project.  In general, students will use the instructors, peers, and other practitioner/research experts for the duration of the Master's Project sequence.In the second course of the three-course Master's Project sequence (MSHE 407) students will learn skills and techniques for collecting original data. Data collection methods include surveys, interviews, observation, and artifact/archival analysis. Students will then create a data collection plan and begin to gather data.",

How does the source and type of knowledge interact with socio-political-cultural constructs and systems of power and, in turn, how can \"knowledge\" be used to produce and/or perpetuate power and privilege or to empower those who are marginalized? Finally, how does what we do in SESP and at Northwestern as both consumers and producers of knowledge fit within the landscape of these questions?In this course students will explore these and other questions to gain insight into the social production, distribution, consumption, interpretation, and operationalization of \"knowledge.\" Using primarily seminar-style discussion, the first portion of the course focuses on building and analyzing theoretical frameworks and applied texts in order to generate a working understanding of \"knowledge\" in its myriad forms.  Among our goals for the first portion of the course is to tie theoretical,  academic, and \"folk\" knowledges to everyday experiences and the world around us writ large.  The second portion of the class will involve a series of applied of cases studies, including welcoming members of the SESP faculty community to present on their research, which we will work to bring into conversation with our generated frameworks regarding the sources, types, and implications of knowledge.",

The course will cover normative development (what are the typical changes that occur for children) and individual differences (how do children differ from one another and why).

Our review of human development will center on the scientific literature that has led to the knowledge we have today. This course will stimulate a critical analysis of this literature to identify strengths, gaps, and important next steps for future research.

    "ClassOverview": "Intended as an introduction to design, this course will help us ask a series of questions about our relationship to the world: How can we encourage and drive meaningful social change? How can we design and implement effective and inspiring programs that address social injustice? How can the process of design help us realize human rights, secure civil rights, and take a stand against oppression in our communities, across our country, and around the world? We will attempt to answer these questions by exploring specific steps of the design process. A goal of this course is to acquire an intellectual and applied understanding of the principles of program design and development, which include consideration of historical context and issues affecting the quality of program implementation. We will focus on specific steps within the design and implementation process, as well as case studies of real-world programs with a focus on anti-oppression. We will examine a range of topics, including: finding inspiration and drawing on emotion to direct and redirect our focus; audience-centered design and the identification, recruitment, and retention of target audiences; creating strategic goals and writing learning goals; and ensuring sustainability. What counts as a social need or social problem is subjective and complex, and programs can therefore be difficult to conceive, manage, modify, and evaluate. In light of this, our exploration of designing for social change will include consideration of the organizational, ethical, and political contexts of program implementation. Course assignments are student driven and include Journal Entries and Creative Sparks. Starting early in the quarter, students will work in teams on a Design Project to design and write an implementation proposal for an original social program.",

Abolition is how we get free.\"This get-your-hands-dirty course is an invitation to experiment with abolition and decarceration to imagine worlds where policing, incarceration, and surveillance cease to exist. This means designing futures in which the \"carceral archipelago\" becomes obsolete. Together, we will employ principles of liberatory design and activate our collective imaginations to conceive worlds rooted in transformative justice and community accountability. Over the course of the quarter, you will explore your identity as an abolitionist and develop your craft as a transformative practitioner. Our shared work does not seek to simply demolish carceral systems and replace them with new alternatives, but radically reimagine ways of life without carceral enclosures.",

More precisely, we will focus here on historical and contemporary issues of equity in education based upon the divisions of American society according to presumptions around what race means, i.e. what it tells us about who and how people are. Through our 1) generous listening & dialogue, 2) critical analyses of empirical & theoretical data and 3) deep thinking & writing, we will wrestle with a number of ideas and perspectives. Yet, central to this course is knowledge of the myriad, though sometimes nuanced ways that racism has and continues to operate as a tool of exclusion, disenfranchisement and violence towards individual persons and communities. Equally important, are the intellectual, sociopolitical and pedagogical efforts of individual and collective entities to resist, persist and thrive in the face of injustices.",

    "ClassOverview": "Together, we will explore the complex relationship between the emergence, existence, and (often) endurance of pressing social problems (e.g. inequality, discrimination, illness, hunger, poverty, violence) and the creation and implementation of policies meant to address them. Policy can define much of social life. It can determine who receives access to resources and services and who does not; what types of behavior are restricted and punished, and what types are rewarded; and how individual needs are balanced with a (far from consensus-) understanding of the collective, common good. Social policy, in other words, exists in a contested space, and one that shapes opportunities, resource structures, and life outcomes for individuals and communities. In the first part of the course, we will explore the political process by which these important policies are made. We will interrogate why some social problems receive more policy attention than others, how and by whom policy agendas are set, whose voices are listened to, and under what conditions meaningful policy change and transformation occurs. In the second part of the course, we will focus on policy implementation, exploring how policy moves through the regulatory system and is eventually carried out by front-line workers (e.g. teachers, social workers, police officers) who interface with the public. We will investigate how these interactions impact individuals and communities, ultimately shaping what the consequences of policy look like on the ground. Throughout the quarter, students will learn how to frame, write, and present a policy brief on an important social issue. We are excited to learn with you this quarter and to create an engaged, compassionate space for thinking about the most pressing social issues around us today.",

    "ClassOverview": "The gap between rich and poor is significantly larger in the United States than it was 40 years ago. In this course we explore why this may have happened and what policies have been attempted to address the causes and consequences of inequality. We will investigate these questions through the lens of economics, and will learn fundamental economic concepts as a way to answer these questions. The first part of the course will begin with a discussion about what inequality is and how to measure it. We will discuss how inequality in earnings, wealth, and wellbeing have changed in the U.S. over time, and will talk about various economic theories to explain these changes. The second part of the course will explore policies designed to address the causes and consequences of inequality. We will also learn about fundamental economic concepts - including opportunity cost, comparative advantage, supply and demand, human capital, and individual responses to incentives - as a way to critically examine the effectiveness of these policies. The final part of the course will focus specifically on inequality along race and gender lines, with some attention to whether these differences are the result of discrimination. We will also explore how economic thinking can help us analyze policies designed to address past and present discrimination.",

    "ClassOverview": "Understanding causal relationships is a central goal in social science and science in general. Correlations help to predict outcomes, but if we want to influence outcomes we need to understand causal pathways. It is not sufficient to observe what is happening, we need to know why it is happening. In this course students will learn the toolbox of causal inference econometrics with applications to the economics of health, human capital, and subjective wellbeing. The empirical methods we will cover include multivariate regressions, panel data, difference-indifference designs, instrumental variables, randomized control trials, and regression discontinuities. We will also discuss causal evidence derived from theoretical models and machine learning. Health, human capital, and subjective wellbeing (\"happiness\") are core dimensions of social welfare and inequality in our society. They matter as an outcome for people's lives and they matter as an input into economic and social productivity. Moreover, health, human capital, and happiness are impacted by behaviors and by social and environmental conditions - factors that can be impacted via social policies. To develop effective social policies, however, it is crucial to understand the causal mechanisms driving these factors. We will discuss fetal origins, the impact of air pollution on health, causes and consequences of mental illness in childhood and youth, the impact of income on health, trends in mortality, the economic drivers of fertility, happiness across countries and over time, and the roots of midlife crisis.",

The class is a laboratory in which you will be encouraged to speak publicly about issues that concern you, to share information that interests you and has relevance to a larger audience, and to translate the public speaking forum in terms of your own professional pursuits.You will use the PREP and START Methods to answer questions, Monroe's Motivational Sequence to persuade, and explore non-verbal body language and the \"performance of self\" to become an engaging public speaker.  Becoming aware of your physical and vocal qualities while overcoming nervousness and analyzing your audience will build your skillset to fully engage the crowd.  Improving your critical listening and storytelling skills and learning how to structure a clear message adds to your public-speaking toolbox.You will explore this compelling topic by:\u2022\tEngaging with speech texts and videos\u2022\tPracticing interviewing and pitch sessions\u2022\tDelivering persuasive speeches\u2022\tEnjoying the art of conversation\u2022\tOur culminating activity will be sessions on speed-interviewing where you practice the art of answering questions while fine-tuning the short story of you, your elevator speech.Through short speeches, engaging lectures, personalized coaching sessions, and team-building group projects, each student will receive personalized attention tailored to the realities of academic success. Students will leave the workshop with increased technical and soft skills in effective communication: non-verbal body language, critical listening, storytelling, leadership presence, managing anxiety, and structuring a clear message through visual design.May not be audited.",

    "ClassOverview": "In this writing-intensive course, we will read canonical and non-canonical American texts (novels, films, graphic novels) in order to develop some theoretical sophistication in reading narrative and crafting literary arguments. We explore different methods of interpreting narrative in terms of genre (What happens to us as readers when we place a text in a specific genre, such as the detective story or Great American Novel? How do generic expectations work on our interpretive experience?); aesthetic form (What do we mean when we call a writer's prose \"beautiful\" or a plot well-constructed? How do literary standards work to constitute values?); and ideological content (How do we judge a text's position in relation to historical and contemporary political issues, including-but not limited to-matters of gender, race and class?). Our focusing lens is the theme of criminality: What counts as transgression against norms, both within texts (Who are the criminals? Who makes the laws? What are appropriate punishments for crimes?) and in our wider literary culture (What makes a text worthy or not worthy of being considered literature? Who makes these literary \"laws\"?) As an introductory seminar and requirement for English majors, the course focuses deeply on the composition and revision of effective literary arguments.This course was formerly ENGLISH 298.",

In particular, we will put heavy emphasis on the mathematics of interest rates, including the tools used to value common stock and fixed rate bonds. We will discuss how rates of return for these instruments are measured. We will then look at the capital budgeting process and learn how managers determine in which projects to invest a firm's limited resources. We will also study the probabilistic and statistical tools necessary to understand how investors and financial economists evaluate risk. Primary emphasis will be on an intuitive understanding of portfolio theory and its impact on estimating the expected return on an asset given its systematic risk through use of the Capital Asset Pricing Model. Prerequisite: While there is not a formal prerequisite for this course, it is helpful for students to have a basic understanding of algebra and statistics, especially concepts such as standard deviation, correlation, covariance and regression. Also, some knowledge of accounting is helpful, such as familiarity with balance sheets, cash flow statements, and income statements. The course is conducted completely online.

As such, topics for this course will include understanding organizations as complex social systems; the difference between leadership and managerial authority; navigating the politics of competing factions within organizations to achieve shared goals; how a firm-wide, national, or global event like a pandemic can jolt the very definition of leadership and further require technological advancements, organizational transformation, and proactive and reactive change; emotional intelligence and the role of building and maintaining relationships of trust to drive optimal performance and continuous improvement; and the role of leadership in creating an environment in which risk-taking and innovative solutions are encouraged, learned from, and rewarded.The class, as well as students' experiences, will serve as foundational learning and ultimately become case studies in leadership.",

This course will give a broad overview of the entire field of psychology, which students will learn about through in-class demonstrations, outside observations, discussions, and presentations. We will explore human behavior from a biological, psychological and socio-cultural perspective. We will discuss the history of psychology beginning with an overview of psychology's roots, observing how prevailing paradigms have shifted throughout the centuries. We'll then discuss how to think like a social scientist, with an attitude of open mindedness and skepticism, as we observe people in different social settings. Discussion will include the tools and methods that are used by social scientists to formulate their questions and propose answers. With the tools of neuroscience we will explore the biological underpinnings of mind and emotions and how they influence behavior. We will seek to understand and have empathy with individuals suffering from psychological disorders ranging from mild depression to severe psychosis. Discussion will cover ways to diagnose psychopathology and therapies that have been proposed to heal such internal suffering. Practical skills for coping with stress and emotions will also be explored. Finally, we try to uncover group dynamics that can give rise to pathological and sometimes destructive behavior as that observed in cults. The course will conclude with a theme of malleability that challenges assumptions about how we perceive, remember and think. Carries social science credit.",

Each week we will employ a new skill in this process, by discussing the relevant content, practicing it in action, and directly applying that learning to your individual term projects.

However, attitudes can also take far more complex forms. Society is becoming increasingly aware of the various forms that attitudes can take, and the important consequences that they can hold. In this course, we will situate a longstanding history of scholarship focusing on attitudes within the context of contemporary issues and implications. Specifically, we will consider a variety of basic questions, including: What are attitudes and what functions do they serve? Where do attitudes come from? Can attitudes be unconscious? Are attitudes generally logical and rational or are they emotional and irrational? How do our attitudes influence everyday life? Are there effective ways to change an attitude? We will seek to: a) understand the central role of attitudes in daily life (including your life), b) gain a broad familiarity with how attitudes can be and have been studied scientifically, c) apply course concepts to a topic of personal interest to you, and d) learn to interrogate, object to, or avoid circumstances where attitudes might impose a negative influence on you or those around you.

But what if, in our rush to optimize, we never stop to ask why things are the way they are in the first place?Unlike courses that stress the \"right way\" to navigate or manage organizations, this course equips students with new ways to think more conceptually about what it is that organizations do, and to consider how and why they resemble/differ from one another. Students will learn a theoretical and conceptual vocabulary for describing and making sense of organizational culture, dysfunction, and the broader institutional contexts that shape organizational life.In terms of course expectations, the emphasis is on reading and writing about sociological and historical organizational theory at an introductory to intermediate level, and students will be encouraged to apply course material to experience from their everyday lives.This course is part of the Business Leadership year two cohort.",

    "ClassOverview": "Are gender and sexuality useful categories of analysis in contemporary Middle East? What sexual assumptions underpin studies of the Middle East? And what kind of a Middle East grounds gender and sexuality studies in the region? This course engages with queer studies and critical race and feminist scholarship in anthropology, history and sociology to probe these questions. In this course, we will attend to the formation of \"gender\" and \"sexuality\" as categories of sociocultural analysis, surveying the major shifts within the intellectual history of studies in gender and sexuality, while interrogating the ways in which race, class, and nationality complicate studies of gender and sexuality and of mobility alike. In other words, if one major question that animates the course is what intersectional studies of mobility have to contribute to historical and anthropological studies of gender and sexuality in the Middle East, the other is what kind of new analytical ground studies of gender and sexuality could open up in sociocultural analysis of mobility, migration and transnationalism across the Middle East and Southwest Asia.",

With an acute eye toward human agency, students will explore the myriad ways in which African Americans mobilized their collective resources to demand the recognition of their rights as citizens, women and men, and, more broadly, human beings. This course, thus, explores the myriad ways in which historical actors at the center of dramas challenged racial segregation, exclusion, and discrimination\u2014structural features endemic to U.S. society. In the process, students will engage a problem central to United States history: How do we figure African Americans relationship to the ideologies and institutions at the center of American political development from marginal and subordinate positions? And in what ways do the histories of African Americans demand a rethinking of those ideals embedded in the nation's highest documents?",

How do scholars identify and/or define `race' and `racism' in Latin America? When can we locate and examine `race' and `racism' in the history of Latin America?  How has `race' mattered in the history of the region?  Has `race' always constituted an organizational category throughout Latin America?  And, how have the politics of race and sexuality converged in the making of Latin American Nations? For much of the twentieth century, Latin American nations worked to construct the identities of \"racial democracies\"\u00bfcountries where the scourge of racism and prejudice could not take root due to processes of whitening via mestizaje (racial mixing) and Catholic education.  Yet, in recent decades, several of these countries have come to recognize the failure of such \"projects\" even as a growing number of studies have come to highlight the persistent and insidious patterns of racial discrimination and inequality found throughout the region and its history.  In this course, students will grapple with these ideas, histories, and themes, developing a deeper understand of the social and political implications of race in Latin America.  They will showcase their deepening understanding of these themes in their own words at various points in the course.  Students will also be expected to pay close attention to current events affecting African-descended populations in Latin America.",

In this course, students will explore how the afterlives of colonialism and slavery has shaped the contemporary relationships between Africans and African Americans. A host of cultural forms and expressions offer a lens for reading the political zeitgeist, alliances, contact zones, exchanges, tensions, dissonances, and, importantly, modes of solidarity between Africans and African Americans. Students will explore how writers, musicians, performers, and scholars excavate the ongoing intimacies between the continent and the African diaspora, in a post-Civil Rights U.S. and postcolonial Africa. How do migration patterns, racialized economics, global geopolitics, community activism, and technologies of culture redefine these diasporic encounters? What role does the arts play in achieving social change for our communities?",

Similar claims were made about Covid-19 in the months leading to global spread of this still evolving viral disease. These kinds of statements - and the proliferation of official efforts to both define and control epidemics - show the significance of cultural, social, political and economic dimensions of mass disease events. This seminar privileges a critical medical anthropology perspective on the dynamics of epidemics and pandemics: from defining and naming an event a pandemic, to the ongoing dynamics of disease transmission to prevention and control. Together, we will investigate these pathologies of power: how complex interactions among social, cultural, political, economic, and environmental factors influence the natural history of infectious disease and public health efforts to understand and address them. The seminar focuses on contemporary issues with the explicit purpose of addressing questions of equity and justice.",

Although these are revolutionary advances, the scientific implications of genetic research are not always as straightforward as press releases and media coverage imply; and in some domains genetic research raises thorny new ethical and other societal questions.  In this discussion-based seminar, we will critically read several recent books that tackle various dimensions of the social lives of our DNA, augmented by additional scientific, popular and journalistic readings.  We will address questions that sit at the interface of genetics and society, such as: How do our genes really influence our health?  What are the problems with the concept of genetic race, and why do scientists who study race describe race as a social construct?  How do new genetic approaches help us dig deeper into our ancestries, and what are the societal and ethical implications of those approaches?  Readings for this class will not require specialist knowledge of biology or genetics, but will benefit from a curiosity about science and a willingness to engage in critical analysis and discussion.",

You will do so by reading and writing about a quintessential human space: the city. Today, more than half of the world's population lives in urban areas. The growth of modern cities suggests that humans thrive in urban environments. Cities, however, are a relatively recent phenomenon in history. Further, cities are not essential for human survival. Then, why do cities dominate the modern world? Drawing broadly on scholarship in anthropology and other disciplines, we will read about the characteristics of urban life in human history, from the first experiments with urbanization 6,000 years ago to contemporary global cities. This course is not intended to be an introduction to anthropology or to urban studies. This seminar will be a workshop in which you will be introduced to college-level modes of thinking, writing, and arguing through reading and writing about cities.",

Across the world, states use monuments and archaeological artifacts to present national narratives in museums, ancient sites, and online platforms. In the Americas, nation-states have controlled who has access to the material remains from the past while transforming buildings, historic places, monuments, and artifacts into national patrimony. In the process of creating national patrimony, nation-states often estrange Indigenous communities from their landscapes and their cultural heritage. In this course, we will examine the role of archaeology in the creation and preservation of national identities in the Americas from the 18th century to the present. In weekly readings and discussions, we will learn about the institutionalization of archaeology as a state-sponsored discipline, the development of archaeological sites as national monuments and tourist destinations, the display and interpretation of artifacts in museums and heritage sites, and the monopolization of tangible cultural heritage by the state. Ultimately, we will evaluate the intersections of identity and politics throughout the history of the Americas.",

A range of issues will be considered, including research and writing styles characteristic of all four subfields, clarifying research and writing goals, preparing a critical literature review, data analysis and presentation and, most importantly, writing processes. Students will be expected to make brief presentations (in large and small group settings) about the development of their paper throughout the quarter. The goal for this class is to produce a ~20-page paper that outlines your research questions/issues/problems and presents an analysis using material from field research, laboratory work, data sets or library research; this will serve as the thesis you submit to the Anthropology Department in early spring quarter.",

This is not surprising, since four-subfield anthropology is uniquely positioned to address the complexity of factors that define and motivate food practices. Food is at once culturally defined, biologically necessary, and historically situated. In this class, we will explore how each of the four-subfields has approached food practices and how they change over time. The goal is to understand how the multi-faceted nature of foodways demands a non-disciplinary approach, and how we might better match our methods and writing styles to this subject of study.",

And what kind of a Middle East grounds gender and sexuality studies in the region? This course engages with queer studies and critical race and feminist scholarship in anthropology, history and sociology to probe these questions. In this course, we will attend to the formation of \"gender\" and \"sexuality\" as categories of sociocultural analysis, surveying the major shifts within the intellectual history of studies in gender and sexuality, while interrogating the ways in which race, class, and nationality complicate studies of gender and sexuality and of mobility alike. In other words, if one major question that animates the course is what intersectional studies of mobility have to contribute to historical and anthropological studies of gender and sexuality in the Middle East, the other is what kind of new analytical ground studies of gender and sexuality could open up in sociocultural analysis of mobility, migration and transnationalism across the Middle East and Southwest Asia.",

Throughout the quarter, students will investigate different strategies and modes of exploration and experimentation so that each student may discover what works best in the development and expansion of her or his own daily working process. We may also look at established artists for possible models of active studio practices.",

The question of postmodernism will be important to the course both thematically and chronologically. The second half of the course will focus on the issues raised by the return to representation in painting, by photography and other technologies of reproduction, by new media and genres like video art and installation, by shifts in concern regarding audience and public art, and by increased pluralism and globalism and their impact on our definitions of mainstream and avant-garde.",

In the twentieth and twenty-first centuries artists have used these mediums to express and create political messages that aim to gain social freedoms and fight for civil rights. In this course, we will examine the politics of performance and the performance of politics in movement practices from the late 19th century to the present. We will question and look at the ways that dance interrupts space, is a gesture for protest and engages bodies to foster solidarity. The lens of dance and choreography also offers an expansive means to conceptualize political questions that surround crisis and historical and current lived experiences. Subjects such as AIDS, slavery, history of form and technique, labor, gender, race and class will be topics of inquiry. Who gets to dance and when we do what freedom is called into play?. The course aims to dismantle neoliberal systems through dance and performance history and current practices. We will be engaged by weekly readings and discussion, as well as presentation, field trips and movement exercises.",

They played many variations ofthe exquisite corpse game, they combined collaged elements, ink blots anddrawing, they incorporated chance operations, they engaged in automatic drawing,they turned text into images, and they invented drawing techniques using frottage(rubbings), fumage (drawing with smoke), Rayographs (photograms) anddecalcomania (image transfers). In this course, we'll experiment with many of thesetechniques and, in the Surrealist spirit, we'll try to come up with some of our own.The Surrealists' approach was more often characterized by an \"anything goes\"embrace rather than by heady criticality or judgment, and this course will focusmore on doing and exploring than critique.",

    "ClassOverview": "The French Revolution is widely considered one of the triumphant origins of modern liberal democracy, epitomized by its famous motto: \"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity.\" However, the realities are far more complex (and far less idealistic). The French Republic confronted crisis after crisis as it struggled to integrate the working classes, women, immigrants, and racial and religious minorities into the body politic. France's colonies and the hundreds of thousands of slaves whose labor secured French wealth posed additional challenges to the Revolution's utopian project, ultimately paving the way for the expansion of French imperialism under Napoleon Bonaparte.This first-year seminar examines the significant roles played by art and architecture in producing French citizens and representing Revolutionary values. In addition to canonical artists and architects of the period, such as Jacques-Louis David, Ad\u00e9la\u00efde Labille-Guiard, and \u00c9tienne-Louis Boull\u00e9e, this course also examines popular visual and material culture, including political cartoons, festivals, and costumes. Students will learn how to describe and analyze a wide range of cultural objects, and apply those skills to understand how artworks can intervene in revolutionary conditions to shape political and social realities.",

    "ClassOverview": "From the first announcement of its invention in 1839, photography was linked with the Middle East, where it immediately became a tool of European imperialism in the Ottoman Empire and Qajar Iran. In the nineteenth century, photography served Europe's pictorial transformation of the Ottoman and Qajar worlds into the imaginary \"Orient,\" characterized by backwards spirituality, perverse sexuality, and violent tyranny (hence ripe for European intervention). At the same time, photography was also taken up by a wide array Ottoman and Qajar subjects\u2014from sultans and shahs to artists, scholars, and the Muslim middle classes\u2014who adapted photography's powers to their own ends.This course traces the impacts of Ottoman and Qajar culture, politics, and social history on photography's development as a technology of representation in the nineteenth century. By focusing on photography's entangled history with European colonialism in the Middle East and North Africa, this course highlights Orientalism as both a source of inspiration and a site of contestation for Ottoman and Qajar photographers (and their subjects). The course examines a wide range of photographic genres, including royal portraiture, studio photography, ethnographic photography, and archaeological photography, as well as the many fascinating processes and materials of nineteenth-century photography, from the daguerreotype to photolithography.",

This connection between sculpture and (white) marble only strengthened over the course of the eighteenth- and nineteenth centuries. Yet as we know, ancient Greek and Roman marble sculptures and buildings were painted in vibrant, bright colors. In the Renaissance and Baroque periods, polychrome marble blocks were used to create richly patterned architectural structures. This seminar will take on and challenge the Western conception of \"white marble\" by revisiting its history as a foundational material in the history of Europe Art, from Antiquity to the present. Topics will include the physical qualities of marble, marble quarries, the role of color (both applied and natural), the political and aesthetic debates surrounding antique and modern polychrome sculpture, and the relationship between the aesthetics of white marble and dangerous ideas of white supremacy.",

    "ClassOverview": "In a time of growing awareness of severe environmental crisis, how do artists (and how do we) make change while avoiding despair? This class focuses on ways artists and activists who are motivated by ecological concerns, but also by optimism about the difference they can make, have adapted artistic strategies to address environmental issues over the course of recent decades. Blurring the boundary between art and activism, or art and environmental remediation, they have taken up themes of sustainability and materiality, \"collaborated\" with natural processes, and addressed crises from industrial toxins to global warming. In this course we address key themes in environmental art, considering art, ecology, and politics in relation to issues that include gender, race, poverty, territory, and indigeneity. The course will unfold in conjunction with a performance and class visit by a Kaplan artist in residence and will also involve one or more field trips. Along with class participation and periodic short writing assignments, work will include group and individual final projects.",

What does it mean to ask an original art historical research question? What is historiography and how it is critical for mapping out and developing an original thesis statement and argument? How does one effectively analyze and implement primary sources? What constitutes \"evidence,\" and how is the dominant perception of \"evidence\" shaped by art history's origins?",

We will read critical and theoretical texts that grapple with this question, and test them out through a series of case studies generated by students from their own interests. The seminar addresses theory and historiography from Freud and phenomenology to the New Critics and analytic philosophy of mind to the poststructuralist Death of the Author, as well as theories of collective, distributed, non-human, and networked agency. We will seek to understand why writers have questioned the place of authorial intent in the evaluation or interpretation of a work, as well as critiques and responses to this position. In wresting authority away from the producer, have we given over too much authority to the consumer? Some of our topics may include miraculous (\"acheiropoietic\") objects, images \"made by nature\" and other nonhuman actors, artworks not intended for a human audience, artwork made using the operations of chance, collaborations in which any singular intention is difficult to establish, examples in which intention is simply inaccessible to the interpreter, and examples in which it is, or seems, all too apparent.

We approach these issues as a form of popular culture: what social subjectivities constituted the \"popular\" in early modern Japan, what forms of culture did they use to express themselves, and how did, these dynamics result in the particular forms and functions of the \"floating world\"? We give particular attention to the stratification of society and culture by status, class, and gender, as well as the ways in which different subjectivities intersect and hybridize in cultural production and consumption.

This course examines the relationship between prostitution and literature in Japan during this period: how was the commodification of literature, through the emergence of a commercial publishing industry, related to the commodification of sex? Topics addressed include representation and the use of the courtesan as a literary symbol; tensions between literary image, lived experience, and embodied performance; questions of agency and identity politics, and the methodological challenges of reconstructing marginalized historical subjectivities; the role of media in producing sexual desires and norms of gender; ideological functions of the figures of courtesan and \"geisha\" in modern cultural imaginaries; and more.

    "ClassOverview": "AY22-23This course investigates the intersections between religion and violence in the context of Buddhist Asia while also considering why in many religious traditions there seem to be a link between the two. The course will be structured in two parts: in the first part students will be encouraged to build expertise in the basic concepts, definitions, and general academic consensus (as well as debates) about categories including \"religion,\" \"violence,\" \"sacrifice,\" \"ritual,\" \"martyrdom,\" and also \"nationalism,\" \"politics,\" and \"terrorism\" through reading both primary sources (in English translation) and secondary sources (scholarly writings). We will then move into an analysis of case studies that focus on specific circumstances where Buddhist rhetoric, scriptural authority, and religious practices have played a role in violence including suicide, terrorist-related actions, and self-immolation predominantly in pre- and modern Asia. Some of the provocative questions that this course asks include: Why and how is religion involved in politics? Is Buddhism a pacifist religion? How does religion rationalize violence? How can some Buddhist leaders embrace terror as a political tool? Are the recent practices of self-immolation in Tibet acts of violence? Can non-violence be violent?",

    "ClassOverview": "AY22-23Are our actions free or fated? What larger forces shape the choices we make? To what do we owe our successes, and what is to blame for our mistakes? In East Asian religions, such questions have been answered with reference to a variety of different concepts of fate, fortune, and karma. These concepts shape not only how people have viewed the world, but also how they have made their way through life. This class focuses on religious approaches to questions of destiny in premodern East Asia. We begin by studying Indian Buddhist ideas of karma and early Chinese notions of fate and fortune preceding Buddhism's arrival in China, then turn to the ways people in China and Japan negotiated these various concepts over the many centuries following the arrival of Buddhism. In the end, we discover important throughlines amid the diversity of religious responses to the problem of destiny in East Asian history.",

This course explores the history, literature, philosophy, visual culture, and monastic practices of Chan/Zen Buddhism in East Asia. We pay special attention to the ways Chan/Zen innovated within the Buddhist tradition to establish a uniquely East Asian school of Buddhism. Along the way we consider the changing place of meditation in Chan/Zen practice, closely read Chan/Zen sermons and koans, analyze the role of women and gender in Chan and Zen, and conclude by considering the modern reception of Zen in the West.",

These exercises will lead students toward the completion of a major research paper which is to be submitted at the end of the quarter. Though each student will pursue their own individual projects, they will engage one another's ideas and questions collectively. Each week, students will present their progress, discuss their difficulties, and explore potential avenues of thought through collective discussion. In the final weeks of the course students will exchange drafts and provide commentary and feedback.

We will also look at administrative documents (gzhung yig), other manuscripts and scrolls to become familiar with the most common forms of Tibetan calligraphy.

We begin with a brief history of the field, examining its roots in the philological practices and colonial knowledge production of its various subfields, before moving through the critique of area studies and into contemporary developments. While attending to the epistemological and political stakes of producing scholarship about literature, media, theory, and other forms of cultural production in Asia, we will explore the efficacy of particular practices of interpretation: from modes of theorization and historicization to close reading and translation. In terms of praxis, we will consider how we position ourselves within and between fields through the methods we use in our research. We will ask, for example: how can we make our work legible to scholars in overlapping disciplines and areas while remaining focused on a specific project? How and why might we put our work into dialogue with scholarship from academic fields outside of the Euro-American context? What role does translation play in the interpretive and writing process? How do we identify our audiences and how do we speak to them? Designed for students whose research involves studying aesthetic media and cultural practices in Asia, this seminar will approach these issues by examining the methods employed in recent and past scholarship in the fields that constitute Asian studies.",

We will consider how plant form and function relates to global biodiversity patterns and contributes to the healthy functioning of ecosystems everywhere. Finally, throughout all of these topics, we will consider how humans use plants as sources of food, fiber, shelter, medicines, drugs, and more.",

    "ClassOverview": "*INFORMATION IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE*The information for this section is for Professor Hatim Rahman's section.This course provides students with the social science tools needed to solve organizational problems and influence the actions of individuals, groups and organizations. It prepares managers to understand how to best organize and motivate the human capital of the firm, manage social networks and alliances, and execute strategic change. This is accomplished through knowledge of competitive decision making, reward system design, team building, strategic negotiation, political dynamics, corporate culture and strategic organizational design.The goal of this course is to help you understand what an organizational leader does and to helpyou develop skills to be an effective leader. The course draws on theories and empirical workfrom psychology, sociology, and organizational behavior relating to organizational dynamics,motivation, teams, power and culture. The course is based around the idea that a leader does notneed formal power or authority to lead. Rather, leadership arises from the ability to mobilizepeople around a particular challenge and commitment to take action.In addition to developing skills, as students of the world, we want to have a lens that helps usevaluate the contributions and consequences of leaders. Sadly, not all leaders are effective, andgiven the wrong motivations or circumstances, leaders can be quite destructive. Thus, as we gothrough our weekly readings, I will often ask you to reflect on particular leaders and assess whatthey did well or not so well. Leaders assemble the skills, talents, and resources of individuals andgroups into combinations that best solve those organizational challenges. Effective leaders areable to solve these challenges, improve their teams, cultivate new leaders, accomplishorganizational goals, and (hopefully) improve society in the process. In order to accomplish somany things, they must be able to diagnose problems, make effective decisions, influence andmotivate others, manage diversity, tap into and motivate the human and social capital oforganizational members, optimize cross-functional teams, and drive organizational change. Wewill particularly develop your understanding by confronting how leaders are dealing with issuesat forefront of the \"future of work.\"",

The course is taught by a leader in the Chicagoland non-profit community and combines both a consulting experience with area non-profits facing organizational strategy issues with classroom lectures and discussions on the nonprofit sector.  The class is composed of 25 students who are split into teams of five, and matched with local non-profit organizations and Kellogg MBA mentors, to work on quarter-long consulting engagements.  Students directly engage with their client organizations in the field and then collectively meet once per week to discuss issues and problems they are facing with one another and their instructor, as well as to attend a series of classroom lectures on the nonprofit sector.  To inform and guide students' interactions with non-profits, the classroom sessions will provide an overview of the non-profit sector and the growing trends towards greater accountability, transparency and performance management.  Students will explore the changing roles and responsibilities of non-profits, as shaped by both the public and private sector, and they will examine the implications of these trends.  The course curriculum has two parts: 1) introducing students to the so-called Third Sector and the present political and economic systems that influence how it serves the public good and 2) examining business strategy and management and their applicability to non-profits.  The over-arching goal of the course is to create a foundation of knowledge from which students can draw upon as they work together with community non-profits.  This course is an opportunity to innovate, collaborate, learn and apply a new set of skills and knowledge while impacting the community.",

Occurrences like this - including local ones - will be foregrounded in class readings, discussions, field trips, and assignments. What sustainable solutions are available to mitigate such disasters? What actions can we take to prevent future ones? How can the 12 Principles of Green Chemistry and Engineering be utilized to create a more sustainable future for all? Students will examine behaviors of individuals and institutions, analyzing how those actions contribute to the success - or failure - of a sustainable and environmentally just future. Students will use various forms of media to communicate their findings to the Northwestern community and beyond, culminating in student-directed projects and presentations.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course brings face to face two leading forces of the Byzantine culture:  the Emperor  and  the Saint.  The Emperor is the most visible figure of the Byzantine history.  We know a lot of personal details about each of the thirty seven individuals who sat on the throne during one thousand one hundred years. Their appearance is also familiar to us,  thanks to the Byzantine  coins. The Emperor was the only person entitled to wear red boots. In his presence, his  subjects and foreign ambassadors alike had to prostrate themselves on the ground. It was forbidden to touch the august flesh. The Emperor was the \"animate law\", he was an embodiment of  absolute power, unconstrained by anything.   And yet, the secular authorities in Byzantium always  felt themselves a bit \"illegitimate\": for many \u0441enturies  there was no rule of succession, and each emperor was a usurper. Consequently, even the rituals of power emphasized the perishability of any earthly might. Also, there existed a counterbalance to the Emperor's omnipotence, and, in contrast to the West,  it was not the Church, but the Saint. Also in contrast to the  medieval West, in Byzantium, a holy \"person\"  became a saint not thanks to his or her virtues -- but despite  his or her  transgressions.  The more blatantly did they violate  common norms, the  stronger was their sacred power. The saint  dared to contradict Emperors, to reprove or even condemn them. We can say that Byzantium was an autocratic regime limited by saintly authority of the hooligans.",

    "ClassOverview": "It is perhaps unsurprising that our own time - obsessed as it is with GDP growth, the ups and downs of the stock market, inflation rates, the trade deficit - produces scholarship that studies the ancient Roman economy. This scholarship has made us increasingly aware of how different Rome was from the modern world. This course will focus on what that difference means for the realities of everyday life, both past and present. Questions to be addressed are: What did economic growth mean for the economy of the Romans? Can we even measure it? What role did energy consumption play in economic performance? What was the role of social class in business? What was the influence on the economy of a demographic regime in which life expectancy was low? How was trade conducted over long distances without fast means of communication and transportation? What was the role of technology and technological progress in the economy?",

Can the modern short story still communicate ethical and social truths?  Is the inherent, conclusive brevity and elegance of the genre paradoxically better able to capture the chaos of contemporary life?We will examine works written in a realistic mode and in a fantastic style.  Moreover, we will discuss the elements that define the two approaches with an emphasis on close reading and on the historical and social context of each text.

Along with this were competing debates on social and economic inequali-ties and overlooked sites of intersectional violence. Students will explore how queer and crip frameworks trouble and deepen feminist debates and situate these frameworks in rela-tion to Korea's history of militarism, war, and migration. Course materials include scholar-ship on feminist, queer, and crip theories beyond the Korean context, novel and short sto-ries, TV show, news articles, and films.No prior knowledge of the Korean language or culture is necessary. Course assignments in-clude an individual presentation, a group creative writing project, and a final research pa-per. Student participation, discussion, and peer collaboration are important aspects of this course, and all students will be encouraged to speak in class.",

This seminar is divided into three parts. In the first, we read a series of Kafka's shorter writings, ranging from \"The Metamorphosis\" to some fragments about a man who, though dead, sails on the rivers of the earth. In the second part, we read three writers who absorbed the exactness of Kafka's imaginary into their own work: Jorge Luis Borges, Ingeborg Bachmann, and J. M. Coetzee. In the final part, we return to Kafka and ask ourselves how we see his writing now that we've encountered these transformative readers. During the first two parts, students write brief responses to each week's reading; at the end of the second part, students submit an abstract of their final essay; the third part is reserved for the process of essay writing.",

The course will both examine the specific problems and questions raised by the various texts and consider the texts as history, looking at the ways in which these works both respond to one another and to the political and cultural tensions of their respective eras. We will also consider the ways in which these texts cross disciplinary boundaries or indeed are always already transdisciplinary, constantly moving from the comparatively narrow fields of artistic and literary criticism to fundamental issues of ethics, epistemology, politics, and psychology, and back and forth all over again, always asking ourselves the questions: What are the historical conditions of the ways in which we make and/or think about works of art, broadly conceived, and how does this, in turn, shape the world that art is said to reflect?",

    "ClassOverview": "As a scholar and activist, Silvia Federici interprets Marxism from a feminist point of view, shifting the focus of social critique from production to reproduction.  She has led struggles against privatization and the enclosure of lands and social relations with a specific focus on the commons.  In Nigeria, where she taught for several years in the mid 1980s, she witnessed firsthand the destruction of communal property through the colonial intervention of the World Bank and the IMF.  For her, as a result, the feminist project cannot concern itself exclusively with sexual discrimination, neglecting other political questions.  This graduate seminar explores Federici's understanding of feminism as a history of struggles embedded in other struggles, in constant dialogue with Marxism, antiracism, and environmental politics.  We will assess Federici's criticisms of Marx, Negri, Foucault, Butler, and Haraway while considering her proximity to Vandana Shiva's theory and practice of the commons.  Seminar participants are encouraged to find a way to use Federici's work in their own research projects while exploring anew what Veronica Gago calls \"feminist potential.\"  Keywords: Commons, enclosure, housework, affective labor, the body, ecofeminism, international feminist solidarity.Works by Federici, Shiva, Mies, Marx, Foucault, Fraser, Haraway, Butler, Mohanty and Gago.",

    "ClassOverview": "In recent years, the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements have challenged how scholars approach moral questions surrounding the works, artists or genres they select for syllabi and public exhibitions. Yet as this crucial debate around the ethics of pedagogy has grown, there has been no robust discussion about how we treat these same works in research contexts. What does it mean to feel morally conflicted about picking a novel, theorist, film or image for a class, but less so when it comes to analyzing that same material in an article or talk? As scholars, do we want our object to be \"good\" too much?This is a class about what happens when good scholars study bad things, highlighting how this practice has always been a key part of critique. It is often by running up against critical thought that a media work becomes \"ethical\" or \"unethical\" in the first place. Moreover, the question of how to engage with \"unethical media\" motivates a whole array of critical argumentative comportments - it shows us how to canonize, how to excuse, how to elevate, how to politicize, how to aestheticize, how to love or hate - and in this way the question of ethics helps us to assume the identity of a scholar. To gain perspective on this process, our class will look at the intersection of contemporary theory and moral philosophy, along with films, photographs, graphic novels and radio dramas that try to deal morally with issues of aesthetic distance, visual violence, cancel culture, scholarly privilege, disgrace, eco-pessimism, and the ethical representation of sexuality, gender expression and race.Theorists may include: Chinua Achebe, Elizabeth Anscombe, Lauren Berlant, Judith Butler, Jacques Derrida, Georges Didi-Huberman, Immanuel Kant, Jos\u00e9 Esteban Mu\u00f1oz, Sianne Ngai, Susan Sontag, Judith Jarvis Thompson and Linda Williams.

The study of Earth materials is fundamental to Earth and environmental sciences and deals with formation, stability, environments, and properties of materials that control large-scale processes from weathering to earthquakes. The physical properties of Earth materials are largely controlled by bonding and crystal structure. This course begins with an atomistic approach to understanding mineral properties, but also extends physical properties and mineral stability to the larger geological and planetary scales. The properties of minerals also dictate how we use them for societal applications, ranging from raw materials to chemical filters and energy sources and storage materials. Mineralogy is the application of physics, chemistry, and biology to natural materials, and this course emphasizes the interdisciplinary nature of mineralogy. Students will gain skills in learning to identify the major rock-forming minerals in hand-specimen and in the optical microscope. Students will apply analytical techniques including X-ray diffraction and optical spectroscopy to quantitative analysis of minerals.",

This course is an introduction to the concepts of paleobiology: the nature of fossils, evolutionary trends and adaptations, systematics, paleoecology, and biogeography.  We will investigate how life, from individual organisms to whole biomes, has changed over time; the geologic processes that lead to the burial and preservation of organic material; and the scientific methods by which we infer the biological processes that occurred across deep time from the limited and often biased fossil record.

Informally, economics helps us understand how household, business and government decision makers respond to incentives; the importance of proper-functioning markets in a modern capitalist economy; and the role of government in alleviating various market failures. Microeconomics focuses on individual decisions (typically using cost-benefit analysis) and the inner workings of specific markets.

We will study the behaviour of individuals and firms in a world of limited resources, and the interactions between the two in many different markets. With an emphasis on economic principles, students will be introduced to core terminology and modes of analysis for studying the production and distribution of goods and services in the economy. An overarching goal is to gain insight into how, when, and why markets fail or succeed. Specific topics include supply and demand, market equilibrium, elasticity, costs of production, different degrees of competition (including perfect competition and monopoly), and government interventions (price controls, taxes). You will get started thinking about the three fundamental questions in economics: (i) what goods and services should be produced?, (ii) how do we produce those goods and services?, and (iii) who gets those goods and services? This course is aimed at potential economics majors and students who are curious about having a better understanding of the popular press, or analyzing and comparing different government policies.",

We'll also consider the causes of hyperinflations, the appropriate goals for monetary authorities and the 2007-8 financial crisis.",

    "ClassOverview": "This is an introduction to issues in urban and regional economics. We will study the problems of cities, urban areas, and regions by examining the effects of geographic location on the decisions of individuals and firms. The importance of location in everyday choices is readily seen in your decision to live on or off campus (or in a new professor's decision to live in Evanston or downtown Chicago). Yet, traditional economic models do not account for spatial factors. As urban economists, we will use the tools of economic theory and empirical data to explore several interesting questions along the dimensions of why we live in cities and how do regions develop. These questions include, but are not limited to: Why do cities and regions exist? How do firms decide where to locate? Why do people live in cities? What determines the growth and size of a city and region? What is the role of cities in regional development? We will then analyze the economic problems that arise because we live in urban areas. We will focus on specific urban issues such as firm location, housing, education, transportation costs, immigration, and local government policies. Time permitting, we will briefly explore issues related to crime, poverty, and housing bubbles. We will cover a few empirical papers in class that you are expected to read in advance. Typically, this will involve reading the abstract, introduction, and conclusion of the papers to get a general overview of the contribution, research question and methodological approach.  We will analyze data using Stata or R and may also use ArcGIS, a digital mapping program.",

In this first-year seminar, we'll combine readings of literary classics like The Time Machine and A Christmas Carol with selections from children's literature like A Wrinkle in Time, and modern, mixed-media additions to the canon, including the manga The Girl who Leapt Through Time and the movies Run, Lola, Run and Everything Everywhere All at Once. In this class, students will prepare for their futures at Northwestern by confronting questions about cultural difference, considering whether history can and should be preserved, and blurring the boundaries between \"past,\" \"present,\" and \"future.\"",

These films and dramatizations do much more than allow us to imagine we can witness events we otherwise only read about; they also prompt us to ask questions about past, present, and future. How did prior generations see history, and how does historical imagination change? What do different depictions of events tell us about the societies that produced those representations? What happens when \"history\" receives dramatic embodiment\u2014and who gets to do the (re-)telling? In this class, we will study classic and modern historical dramatizations to consider the imagined audiences for these works, and what happens when they're transmitted to new contexts that their originators never imagined\u2014including now. Our explorations will include staged works running the gamut from Shakespeare to Lin-Manuel Miranda, American history as rendered onscreen by Steven Spielberg, and radical contemporary reexaminations of classic conventions by artists from Germany to Kuwait. In every case we'll be interested in the ways artists and audiences both conceive of and reconfigure a workable past, and how our different pasts change the present and might shape the future.",

    "ClassOverview": "LGBT rights and culture in the US are often neatly framed in terms of a national story, \"beginning\" with the 1969 Stonewall Riots and \"ending\" with the Supreme Court ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges legalizing same-sex marriage. However, recent cultural depictions of historical LGBT activism like It's a Sin (UK, 2021) and BPM (Beats Per Minute) (France, 2017) remind us that queer life and liberation have always been global. This course returns to the 1980s and early 1990s, a period of concentrated political and cultural exchange between the UK and US. During this era, the unfolding HIV/AIDS crisis and the \"special relationship\" between the conservative parties of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher inspired a definitive rise in LGBT activism on both sides of the Atlantic. We will examine a range of artistic and literary responses to this moment to consider how these national contexts are both distinct, with their own prehistories, politics, and cultural forms, and interrelated through the prism of LGBT film, art, and literature. We will ask: how are questions of gender, sexuality, race, and nationhood impacted by making the LGBT canon transatlantic? Was there a prevailing queer \"mood\" or \"attitude\" in this period, and was it nationally specific? How does this comparison change the way we understand the recent past, both in terms of the experiences of sexual and gender minorities and the wider culture? How can reflecting on this history be instructive in the present, as a feedback loop between the US and UK fuels resurgent culture wars around gay and transgender lives and politics in both countries? In addition to visual art, we will consider authors and films like Hanif Kureishi, Paris is Burning, Jeanette Winterson, Audre Lorde, My Beautiful Laundrette, Young Soul Rebels, and Tony Kushner.",

In this seminar, we will engage texts and film versions of A Midsummer Night's Dream, Romeo and Juliet, Twelfth Night, Othello, and Macbeth, including O, She's The Man, Desdemona (by Toni Morrison) and Shakespeare in Love.

Ourmodern moment is full of new versions of old stories, as evidenced by the popular musicalHamilton. What kinds of cultural work are these retellings doing? In this class, we will studycanonical works of nineteenth and twentieth-century American literature alongside modern-day adaptations that revise these texts, particularly with regards to race, gender, and sexuality. How do these adaptations tell us something about the priorities of our culture today? And how do such adaptations challenge our ideas about the meanings and practices of reading and rereading? From a queer adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby and a feminist film version of Louisa May Alcott's Little Women, to a dystopian sci-fi thriller re-imagining The Scarlet Letter, to the critically acclaimed Apple+ TV show, Dickinson, based on the life of Emily Dickinson, this class will examine what such adaptations reveal both about our current moment and our relationship to reading.",

    "ClassOverview": "A short ride on the Purple Line Express will introduce first-year students at Northwestern to the center of a world-class city with a rich history and deep, multi-faceted culture. A walk through downtown demonstrates how Chicago is an ideal site for investigating the ways we imagine and produce space on multiple scales; on a global scale, the city has been a center for innovations in modern architecture; it historically served as a railroad hub and point of connection for the nation; regionally, it has been the cultural center of the Midwest, giving rise to interdisciplinary movements like the Chicago Black Renaissance; and since the early twentieth century, it has been one of the starkest examples of both the devastating effects of urban racial segregation and the ways racialized communities resist this dispossession. In this course, students will encounter literary texts, films, music, and other media made in and about Chicago that reflect and mediate place and space in the city. The guiding questions of this class include: How have Chicago's natural and built environments shaped the novels, films, and music created in the city? How have these works of cultural production, in turn, impacted the way people inhabit and imagine space in Chicago? What can these texts tell us about the way people experience race, gender, and class in the places in which they live, commute, work, and play? This course aims to give students both a deep education in the culture of the metropolitan area they now live in and the analytical skills to investigate the entanglement of space, culture, and politics.",

    "ClassOverview": "Aided by the contemporary 24-hour news cycle, catastrophe is ubiquitous. Social, political, and environmental catastrophes bombard us daily. Yet, for all of its ubiquity, catastrophe resists the reduction to the commonplace. Catastrophes produce feelings of shock, trauma, and upheaval. On a broad scale, they upend systems of organization and structure. On a psychological level, catastrophes fracture ways of understanding the self and the world. For those who survive catastrophic experiences, the catastrophe does not end with the event itself\u2014living in catastrophe's aftermath demands finding ways to stabilize and make sense of a world transformed from seeming order to a state of flux.This class will examine works of literature that attempt to represent catastrophic events from European contact in the Americas to the present, along with contemporary music and film dealing with personal and interpersonal catastrophes (i.e., grief/loss and alien/artificial intelligences, respectively). Readings will feature American writers from the canonical to lesser-known including Ralph Lane, Crevecoeur, Melville, Whitman, Simon Pokagon, William Joseph Snelling, Poe, and Layli Long Soldier. Films include Ex Machina (2014), Arrival (2016), and This Much I Know to Be True (2022). For music, we'll venture to Australia, listening to albums by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds (Ghosteen 2019) and Nick Cave & Warren Ellis (Carnage 2021).We will pay particular attention to the formal textual strategies used in texts as they wrangle with representing the catastrophic, attending both to the ways texts (including films and albums in the category) use generic conventions and rhetorical strategies to stabilize themselves in a state of flux, and to the moments when those conventions and strategies fail, rupture, or break, and, in turn, are rearticulated. By examining textual breakage and reassembly, we will try to think about parallels between writing that makes sense of the unmooring effects of catastrophe and college-level writing that engages with complex, ongoing, emerging, and sometimes disorienting conversations and arguments. Our purpose will be to better understand how to make sense of complicated situations and contexts through descriptive, summative, and argumentative writing that carefully synthesizes complex sets of evidence.",

This class asks not just what a poem means, but also how it means and makes meaning in the first place. Together, we'll learn about different approaches to poetic interpretation, explore different ways of thinking about poetry, and develop our own unique ways of engaging with poems. Paying attention to poetic form, we'll practice discussing and crafting arguments about poetry, and learn to support our readings and interpretations with textual analysis. Throughout, we'll be reading plenty of American poetry from the mid-19th, 20th, and 21st centuries, such as June Jordan, Audre Lorde, Leonard Cohen, Craig Santos Perez, Frank Ocean, Shirley Geok-Lin Lim, Layli Long Soldier, and many others.As a skills based class, you should expect to walk away with the tools to help you understand, analyze, and write about poetry at a college level, as well as preparation to continue studying poetry throughout your college career. This class is made both for people who love poetry and find it easy to understand, as well as those who don't like it, are scared of it, or find poems difficult. Poetry is one of the most mysterious thing that we can do with words; together we'll start to unwrap that mystery step by step.",

Through exercises and projects, you'll practice using these tools to produce original, exciting works of literary art. Along the way, you'll sharpen your ability to track these elements both in published texts and in the work of your classmates, and further develop how you measure aesthetic value. You'll be encouraged to see yourself as an active member of a community of artists, and to establish a regular discipline as a working writer. Writing and reading will be due in nearly every class, and peer workshop will play an important role in learning to see your work more objectively.",

Readings will range from discussions of the graphic novel to considerations of how everyday citizens manipulate social media to tell the stories they desire (or vice versa). We will also look at case studies that illustrate how the ever-widening gulf between the stories told by specialists and non-specialists plays out in the public sphere and the making of public policy.This course is recommended for students who wish to refine their mastery of the essay form while experimenting with a range of creative approaches to articulating arguments and persuading audiences. Key assignments will require research into a question of the student\\'s own choosing, refined and developed over the course of the quarter. Students are welcome to use this class to deepen their explorations of research problems that they may have begun investigating in other classes or contexts.",

    "ClassOverview": "What is folk horror, and why have witches, deals with the devil, and pagan cults gained such a hold on audiences today? Embracing the weird and the eerie, unsettling and uncanny, folk horror is at once a relatively new genre and as timeless as folklore itself, with origins in the superstitions and tales circulated long before the printed word. Working with plays, short stories, films, folk songs, and historical documents, this class will attempt to better define folk horror as a genre with storied, complex roots, and also account for its unmistakable modern renaissance. Our search for answers will take us back to the 17th century and its tempestuous transition into so-called modernity: how do plays about the perils of selling one's soul like Doctor Faustus and The Late Lancashire Witches testify to distinct historical anxieties, as well as dramatize growing tensions between urban and rural, reason and superstition? And how do these texts anticipate viewers' tastes centuries later for films like The Wicker Man and, more recently, Midsommar--movies which draw upon our modern fears and desires for rituals older than the capitalist clock, and a more communal, pastoral past? In addition to considering how folk horror has addressed anxieties around class, race, and gender over time, we will particularly attend to the relationship these texts and films explore between humans and the natural world--an environment in turn timeless and imperiled, comforting and terrifyingly unknowable.",

    "ClassOverview": "Maybe everyone has heard of the star-crossed lovers Romeo and Juliet, whether they know Shakespeare's play or not.  But their story did not start or end with Shakespeare.  Almost three hundred years earlier, Dante mentions them in passing in the Divine Comedy.  More than three hundred years later, they turn up in West Side Story as teenagers from different backgrounds in gentrifying Manhattan, and they appear in dozens of other versions in between.  They owe much to traditions of both courtly love and bawdy country stories, and they in turn have given us many of our ways of understanding love.  Idealized or criticized, Romeo and Juliet seem to slip free of the work in which they appear to lead many other lives.  In this class we will explore some of the ways Shakespeare's play and Romeo and Juliet's story have appeared and reappeared, changed and persisted.  We will use this body of writing to explore different ways of reading and interpreting literature. We will also learn how we use this story to think about values, about love, about violence, and about stories themselves.",

The course is practical in that it is designed to prepare incoming tutors for their work at the Writing Place. This course also focuses heavily on both classic and current theories of the teaching of writing and of writing center-specific pedagogies. We will introduce you to classic works of writing center theory while also asking you to engage in more contemporary debates and studies in the field. Through a combination of reading about writing center pedagogies and practicing engaging with those methods in your work at the Writing Place, Practical Rhetoric seeks to prepare you to effectively coach writers at all stages of the writing process. In the spirit of the collaborative writing process that is at the heart of the Writing Place's mission, as writers this quarter, this course will ask you to regularly bring your own writing to class to workshop in a series of mock consultations and writing exercises with your classmates. You will reflect on your own positionality as a writer-- and consider what that positionality brings to your work at the Writing Place-- in a short writing assignment the first week of the quarter. You will continue to reflect on your learning in Practical Rhetoric and on your experiences working at the Writing Place in a series of weekly tutor journals. We will ask you to contribute to the work of writing center studies through your own research proposal, ideally on a topic or initiative that you can continue developing and perhaps even put into action in later quarters to improve and grow our services at the Writing Place. And at the end of the quarter, you'll bring everything you've learned together to articulate your personal tutoring philosophy.",

At other times, we write because we need to imagine a world that we have not yet witnessed. And then, at times, we find ourselves witnessing more than we could have ever anticipated. The author Michael Cunningham observed, \"If you survive a war or epidemic, your sense of life and the world is changed\u2026And you work with that.\"Given the large-scale events that we are witnessing, from the pandemic and police brutality to the climate crisis, how do we negotiate with this material as writers? How, in our creative works, does language and narrative change in light of such circumstances?In this course, we will read fiction, creative nonfiction and poetry engaged with these questions of the writer as witness, including works by Edwidge Danticat, Alejandro Zambra, and Claudia Rankine among others. We will discuss experiments with point of view and structure, as well as the ways that writers use techniques like anaphora across genres. You will write three short works and a longer work in the genre of your choice. Writing exercises will support you in generating new works, and small group workshops, in addition to the traditional workshop, will provide you with feedback on your writing in a variety of ways.",

And yet romantic and erotic desire are the very motors not only of social relations but of narratives and fiction. In great novels, we as readers hang as much on the outcome of romantic entanglements as we do on the solution of crimes. How do our desires and the characters' desires entwine in the phenomenon we call \"narrative desire?\" And what are the dangers of identifying with the characters and outcomes of a supremely \"plotted\" world? We will look at four classic novels in which the dangers of desire are figured, variously, as class snobbery, identity theft, sexual violence, betrayal, and vampirism!",

Over the course of the quarter, we will explore the ways in which Chaucer experiments with late medieval literary genres, from chivalric romances to bawdy fabliaux, frustrating and playing upon the expectations of his audience.   Against and alongside this literary context, we will consider the dramatic context of the pilgrimage itself, asking questions about how the character of an individual pilgrim, or the interaction between pilgrims, further shapes our perceptions and expectations of the tales:  How is a romance different, for example, when it is told by a knight, by a social climber, or by a renegade wife?   We will be reading Chaucer's poem in the original Middle English.  At the end of the quarter, we will give an in-class performance of one of the tales.",

    "ClassOverview": "Whether it causes fear or fascination, blood holds a mysterious sway on the modern imagination. From those who faint at the sight of it, to those who love vampire movies and gory thrillers, to those who study and analyze it in labs, this strange substance serves as a constant source of conflict, anxiety, and ideology. Representations of blood in medieval literature were just as fraught. Medieval people saw the substance as alternately miraculous and polluting, life-giving and death-bringing, a marker of difference and a symbol of unity. Blood had the capacity to reveal whether a person was sick or healthy, whether they were sexually active, what god they worshipped, and even whether they were guilty of murder. If it was shed on a battlefield it was considered valiant; if it was shed from the bodies of virgins or martyrs it was considered holy; if it was shed during childbirth or menstruation it was considered polluting; and if it was shed in pursuit of love it was considered romantic. In this class, we will explore these complex and often contradictory representations of blood and bloodshed in medieval literature. By approaching this topic from a range of genres and sources (chivalric romance, crusade chronicles, medical compendia, and vampire movies) and theoretical perspectives (queer theory, disability theory, race theory), we will use blood as a starting point for exploring broader questions about gender, religion, culture, and individuality. Moreover, we will consider how medieval assessments of blood value, purity, and pollution continue to shape constructions of identity today.",

In this seminar we will ask: how did poets explore the emotional chaos caused by love by delving into other issues-- how to express feeling in writing, how to get ahead in the world, how to believe in intangibles, and how to \"possess\" others imaginatively? How were the seemingly private issues of love deeply intertwined with power brokering, religious struggles, sexual politics, race, nationalism, and gender identity? When did love cement social bonds and when was it an unruly force that seemed to unravel the very fabric of the self or the nation? And how did poets investigate and express love by creating a mash-up of inherited conventions, philosophies, and beliefs? We'll tackle these questions by reading poetry in the context of early modern religious controversies, court politics, colonialism, same-sex desire, feminism, medical theory, and science.",

    "ClassOverview": "Jane Austen's beloved classic novels are often characterized as sweeping romances\u2014but are they? Sense and Sensibility notoriously pairs its fanciful young heroine with a solemn middle-aged man she admires, but perhaps does not love; Mansfield Park ends with a peaceable marriage between two cousins who received more exciting proposals elsewhere; and even the heroine of Pride and Prejudice\u2014that seeming romance par excellence\u2014only begins to consider the hero as a romantic possibility after seeing his extensive estate. Readers of Jane Austen, know that love\u2014be it affection, admiration, or desire\u2014is never not a complicated emotion. In this class, we will read Austen's works with an eye to investigating how she uses narrative to capture the richness of what were known in the 18th century as \"the passions.\" How do we recognize what we are feeling, and how are these feelings shared\u2014between individuals, or in prose? We will particularly consider Austen's gift for portraying what the critic Sianne Ngai deems \"ugly feelings,\" messy, negative affects like envy, irritation, disgust, and numbness that prove critical to Austen's sharp social commentary. While this class will particularly focus on reading Austen's six novels, as well as some of her juvenilia and her unfinished novel, Sanditon, we will also turn to selections by her contemporaries\u2014including Mary Wollstonecraft, Jane Collier, Phillis Wheatley, and Joanna Baillie\u2014as well as recent film adaptations of her works to further contextualize Austen's view of the passions in light of the period's revolutionary discourse around gender, race, and class.",

Jane Austen's chaste courtship plots were preceded by renditions of desire, frustration, rebellion, and amorous failure.  Due to women's exclusion from most forms of paid labor, girls were expected to become wives.  This expectation was interrogated and subverted in British prose fiction across the \"long\" eighteenth century (1660 - 1820).  We'll encounter extra-marital sex, sapphic desire, incest, sex work, delusion, discipline, remarriage, and many other plot twists which show that the road to the courtship plot was rocky, contested, and definitely not predictable.  Texts not purchased in hard copy will be available in a course pack (these are Penelope Aubin, The Life of Charlotta Du Pont, An English Lady; Henry Fielding, The Female Husband).",

Tracing the afterlives of Bront\u00eb's confined madwoman through twentieth-century reimaginations of the trope, including Shirley Jackson's Haunting of Hill House, Jean Rhys's Wide Sargasso Sea, and recent films such as Hereditary, this course will examine how \"insanity\" has been seen as a category useful for regaining (and sometimes blocking) political and literary agency. Putting these texts and films in dialogue with critical responses by Michel Foucault, Gayatri Spivak, and others, we will explore the knotty question of how madness shapes our culture's narratives about gender and authority.",

Why are secrets so endemic in postcolonial culture in both the political and the personal realm, and how do they work? Colonial cultures have depended on secrets and lies to maintain order. But what are the implications for a society that remains silent about some of its darkest crimes and traumas? In this seminar, we will read three postcolonial novels set in three very distinct postcolonial cultures\u2014Seamus Deane's Reading in the Dark (Northern Ireland), Arundati Roy's The God of Small Things (India), and Viet Thanh Nguyen's The Sympathizer (Vietnam and Los Angeles)\u2014in order to think about these questions. We will consider how a legacy of violence\u2014physical, psychic, and sexual\u2014manifests itself when it cannot be spoken out loud. We will discuss how secrets and lies are both specific to place and context, and fit into a pattern of control and silencing that is recognizable across cultures. How can a code of silence create the conditions for traitors, informants, and double agents? How can fiction help to reveal some of these hidden codes and give voice to the silenced? Why might the horror genre be well suited to raising some of these questions? In addition to a close reading of these three novels, we will look at a variety of recent memoirs, graphic novels, films and television episodes to enrich our reading, including: excerpts from Say Nothing by Patrick Radden Keefe, Thi Bui's illustrated memoir The Best We Could Do, selected episodes from the Netflix series The Crown (\"Hyde Park Corner,\" \"Tywysog Cymru,\" and \"Hereditary Principles\"), Apocalypse Now, the documentary Meet the Patels, and Jordan Peele's film Get Out.",

    "ClassOverview": "An encyclopedic epic that tracks three Dubliners' criss-crossing adventures on 16 June 1904, James Joyce's landmark Ulysses (1922) captures a day in the life of a semicolonial city in a wealth of analytic--in his word, vivisective--detail. Proposing that Ulysses has much to teach us about how to read our own everyday worlds, we'll study the book's eighteen episodes alongside Homer's Odyssey and other sources, notes, and commentaries. In thinking about the fictional Dubliners who populate Ulysses, we'll consider Joyce's transmutation of Homer's Odyssey into a modern epic quest; Ireland's long colonial history and its struggle to throw off British rule; characters' conflicting dreams of a subject or sovereign Ireland; resonances of home, exile, and homecoming; psychoanalytic theory of the unconscious and \"the psychopathology of everyday life\" (Freud); scapegoat dynamics in theory and everyday practice; bodies, sensation, food, peristalsis, hunger, sex; desire, the gaze, gender, gesture, dress, and social power; performance--studied and unconscious--and theatricality; the pain and mourning of loss; the power of love; the scalpel of wit; the social life\u2014and political bite--of jokes, comedy, satire, humor; the socio-economic sex/gender system, including marriage and prostitution, as key to political authority in light of Joyce's reported remark that women's emancipation is \"the greatest revolution of our time in the most important relationship there is\"; intersubjective dynamics, human and animal, dead and alive; history, time, memory, monuments; the powers and pleasures of language; the play of voices: narrative voice, interior monologue, dialogue, colloquy, reported speech, telling silences, omniscient authority, poetry, news, advertising, jokes, parody, obfuscation, song, music, play script, letters, catechism, allusion, citation; noises and soundscapes from the cat's \"mrkgnao\" to a screeching tram and characters' inner, speaking, and singing voices; the worldly diction of Joyce's beyond-English; and more. Together we'll approach this challenging, maddening, amazing, exhilarating, funny, moving, deeply rewarding book in ways playful and critical, jocoserious and analytic, and we'll seek revelation by engaging it with serious purpose and imaginative freedom.",

If only a knight in shining armor would arrive on the scene to untangle the web of lies, or rescue the damsel in distress, or solve the puzzle of \"whodunit?\"  And that's exactly how fictional detectives are often characterized.  Indeed, the very first fictional detective, Edgar Allan Poe's C. Auguste Dupin, had the title Le Chevalier, the French word for a knight.  This figure of the knight invites us to consider the detective's investigation as a lonely, but noble and heroic, quest for the truth.  It also invites us to assume that the quest is undertaken by a gentleman for the sake of a lady's honor, and that the grail-like truth is something that only he will be able to discover.  What happens, however, when the truth-seeker is no longer a man of honor, or a man at all?  Or, when the lady in question is no longer in distress, but the cause of the distress?  Or, when the social order on whose behalf the detective-knight supposedly works is no longer committed to seeking the truth but to covering it up?  That's when things get interesting.  We'll begin our class with Poe's \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue,\" which raises in pointed fashion the question of human culpability and bestial violence, and end with Colson Whitehead's The Intuitionist, which transforms the detective's traditional powers of \"deduction\" based on empirical evidence into something like its opposite, pure \"intuition.\"  Along the way, we will examine who comes to occupy the position of the detective, and how the identity of the detective affects both the search for truth and its relationship to power.  And, just for fun, we'll explore how reading a novel or viewing a film is like the work of detection.",

    "ClassOverview": "Monstrosity is ubiquitous in contemporary popular culture. The ghosts, zombies, vampires, poltergeists, and extra-terrestrials that populate this course's syllabus register that modern fascination. From classic horror by H. P. Lovecraft, probing at the margins of civilization, through Angela Carter's monstrous fables, to recent novels and movie adaptations such as Let the Right One In and Coraline, this course grapples with the taboo forms of subjectivity, filiation, and national identity that monsters embody. Analyzing fiction by Shirley Jackson and Neil Gaiman, blockbuster films such as The Shining and Alien, as well as parodies like What We Do in the Shadows, students will explore what representations of monstrosity reveal about our understandings of self, family, and nation. In addition to classic and contemporary examples of cinematic and literary horror, we will explore the genre through multiple scholarly frameworks, including psychoanalysis and disability studies.",

    "ClassOverview": "This selective-enrollment, yearlong \"Sequence\" is designed to make students increasingly informed readers and self-sustaining apprentices of poetry.  The Fall portion of the course begins with summer reading and intensive study in which poets learn to identify operative modes in poetry\u2014including description, rhetoric, story and song\u2014and begin connecting contemporary participants with root systems in the tradition. We support our studies with reading exercises and \"imitation\" assignments, in which students convert close reading into fodder for original writing. Students will write at least four papers and will write, workshop and revise four poems during the Fall term. They also will lead presentations on one chosen poet and one classmate during workshop. In the Winter term, students will continue to read and complete close reading assignments and will stretch their skills as they complete a week of \"Daily Poems,\" thereby drawing on original energy and stamina to bring their work to the next level of accomplishment. Finally, in the Spring term, students will focus entirely on their own work, drafting, revising, workshopping and completing one long poem of at least 120 lines that combines autobiographical material with writing from research. Throughout the year, our close reading assignments hone skills in sensitive and critical thinking; our imitation poems challenge existing habits as they introduce new strategies; our Daily Poems exercise agility and confidence; and our workshops cultivate the openness and humility necessary to serious writing and lifelong learning. Through this intensive and nurturing Sequence, students become careful readers of each others' work and complete a polished portfolio of original writing.",

We'll be looking at, discussing, writing about, commenting on, and researching the elements of fiction, but mostly what we'll be doing is writing buckets (you will be turning in a completed piece every other week during the Fall quarter), so we'll be reading mostly to steal: we'll figure out what works and we'll use it for our own material. We'll be engaged in the reading of a concise, funny book on the craft of fiction, and we'll also be reading a wide and varied array of short stories. Again, though, this work is geared to do one simple thing: to find out what means and modes of expression you best respond to, and to figure out ways to approach this question: Given all the other potentially more awesome forms of entertainment out there, what is the role of sitting around scribbling things and reading other people's scribblings? Why do it? Just so you know, what we're doing in class closely replicates what all successful fiction writers do on a daily basis: reading the work of their peers and those of established and emerging authors with care, attention, and greed, and writing copious amounts to see what sticks. The more you do both of these activities, the better and more confident you'll get.",

Imperial sedition laws marking colonized subjects as insurgents continue to operate in South Asia well into the twenty-first century; the rhetoric of the US-led \"Global War on Terror\" has sparked a new method of postcolonial securitization. This course will embark on a comparative expedition that follows the affordances and differences between colonial/postcolonial South Asia and contemporary US empire through literature, history, and theory.  We will grapple with political concepts like mutiny, Naxalism, separatism, counterinsurgency and securitization by reading contemporary novels, poetry, prison memoirs, and graphic novels from South Asia, Middle East, and the US. \"Terror in the Postcolony\" will explore colonial, postcolonial and US imperial representations of anti-state violence that complicate the ideology of terrorism by turning to literary resistance. Works may include Rudyard Kipling's Kim, Art Spiegelman's In the Shadow of the Towers, Malik Sajad's Munnu: A Boy from Kashmir, Kamila Shamsie's Home Fire, Solmaz Sharif's Look, and Aria Aber's Hard Damage.

However, they are increasingly imperiled by an array of anthropogenic stressors, including pollution, overexploitation of natural and non-living resources, and climate change. This class will focus on both the threats posed to ocean ecosystems, including impacts on marine living resources. The focus of the course will be on the role of international law, including treaties and customary international law, in addressing threats to the world's oceans. A large portion of the course will focus on the provisions of the so-called \"constitution for the oceans,\" the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.",

The class will cover these effects, their impact on Native American and non-Native communities, the maple syrup industry, and maple species themselves through articles and readings. Along with a focus on maple syrup production, we will cover aspects of food sovereignty happening across the United States, Canada, and other parts of the world. Examining how communities and countries are looking inward towards traditional economies and practices to adapt to a changing climate.  Through field observations of climatic and natural phenomena, students will work in groups to collect data from three maple species on campus. The groups will examine and record sugar ratios, sap flow rates, and ambient temperature and precipitation: along with a focus on species differentiation, soil nutrients, and campus micro-climates. The final product for the class would be a group data report. A copy of the report will go to facilities management to be added to their campus tree inventory.",

    "ClassOverview": "Climate change is the keystone environmental issue of this generation, and most likely for many generations to come. While the world community and individual countries have formulated policies to address climate change, these policies are almost universally recognized as being wholly inadequate to effectuate the objective of the Paris Agreement to hold global temperatures to well below 2\u00baC above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit increases to 1.5\u00baC.  Indeed, it has become increasingly obvious that achievement of Paris temperature objectives will require both aggressive emission reduction initiatives and large-scale deployment of carbon dioxide removal/negative emissions technologies and processes (CDR), sometimes also referred to as a major sub-category of climate geoengineering. Moreover, many believe that we will also need to deploy solar radiation management approaches, which seek to reduce the amount of incoming solar radiation, to buy us time as we decarbonize the world economy.This course will discuss the exigency of deploying SRM and CDR approaches at scale, including potential benefits and risks of these options. It also will discuss regulatory and governance considerations at both the national and international level, as well as strategies to incentivize large-scale adoption of these approaches.",

In this course we learn the main concepts about disaster such as preparedness, vulnerability, resilience, response, mitigation, etc. We learn that a disaster does not have the same effect on everyone (all groups of people), and factors of social inequality such as race, ethnicity, class, and gender, make people more vulnerable to impacts of disasters. Also, this course, with an interdisciplinary perspective, analyzes disasters in the global North and South. This is a discussion-intensive course for advanced undergrad students. The classes are the student-centered with an emphasis on collaborative learning.

This class focuses on ways artists and activists who are motivated by ecological concerns, but also by optimism about the difference they can make, have adapted artistic strategies to address environmental issues over the course of recent decades. Blurring the boundary between art and activism, or art and environmental remediation, they have taken up themes of sustainability and materiality, \"collaborated\" with natural processes, and addressed crises from industrial toxins to global warming. In this course we address key themes in environmental art, considering art, ecology, and politics in relation to issues that include gender, race, poverty, territory, and indigeneity. The course will unfold in conjunction with a performance and class visit by a Kaplan artist in residence and will also involve one or more field trips.

    "ClassOverview": "Geography 312 devotes a full quarter to the geography of Chicago and the surrounding region. The \"region\" refers variously to the Midwest, the state of Illinois, Chicagoland, or just to Chicago and its suburbs. Introductory materials include the kinds of data that have been used to study and describe Chicago. Following that comes the necessary background on the changing physical environment of Chicago since the Pleistocene, including the step-by-step evolution of Lake Michigan. Human groups are traced from prehistory through the Native tribes that inhabited the region at the time of European contact. We will follow the record of land treaties, whereby the Native inhabitants lost their lands, which was followed by land subdivision and land grants made by the U.S. government around 1800. Chicago grows into a major industrial center during the 19th century which sees a series of shifts in population composition due to migration. The first part of the course ends with the Burnham Plan, which marks a turning point in Chicago history as a major city. The second part of the course traces the themes of 20th century Chicago geography, especially the role of the African American population and the continued arrival of new immigrant groups from Latin America and Asia. Contemporary problems, including racism, suburbanization, depopulation, and changing demographic and economic patterns are the final topics.",

We will consider case studies from around the continent that examine ancient responses to climate change and poverty, and how they might inform present day challenges.

We will explore the rise of cultural norms surrounding death, love, friendship, faith, and violence.

We will then turn to the most important literary phenomenon of that moment in French literary history: the astonishing re-invention of French theatre by such playwrights as Sartre, Beckett, and Genet. We will explore not only how these authors all take up and rework elements of Existentialist thought, but also how, in critiquing Existentialism's fundamental assumptions, both Beckett and Genet anticipate in different ways the thought of such post-Existentialist thinkers as Deleuze and Foucault.",

In this course, students will explore and consider these ethical challenges. In so doing, students will examine core global bioethical concerns - such as structural violence - and core global bioethical codes, guidelines, and principals - such as beneficence and solidarity - so they will be able to ethically assess global health practices in a way that places an emphasis on the central goal of global health: reducing health inequities and disparities. With an emphasis on the ethical responsibility to reduce disparities, we consider some of the most pressing global bioethical issues of our time: equity, fairness, and climate change. Particular attention is given to the ethics of research during a pandemic and access to vaccines and therapies for Covid-19.",

Students explore the following questions: how do cultural systems of meaning and behavior affect the vulnerability of individuals within the population to mental illness and the mental illnesses to which they are vulnerable? How does culture influence the way that mental illness is expressed and experienced and how does this affect our ability to measure psychological illness cross-culturally? How do cultural factors affect the way that mental illnesses are diagnosed and labeled, and the degree to which they are stigmatized? And how do such factors affect our ability to create effective global health interventions? Finally, how do healing practices and the efficacy of particular treatments vary across cultures? We will examine these and related questions in the context of specific forms of psychological distress, including depression, trauma, dissociation and psychosis, using case studies from a range of cultural contexts including Brazil, Japan, India, China and the U.S.",

Drawing primarily on examples from recent history, including conflicts in the Balkans, Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Middle East, we will explore warfare as a crucial sociopolitical determinant of global health disparities and consider organized efforts to respond to the health impacts of mass violence. Key topics that we will consider include variations in the relationship between warfare and public health across eras and cultures; the health and mental health impacts of forced displacement, military violence, and gender-based violence; and the roles of medical humanitarianism and humanitarian psychiatry in postwar recovery processes. Through close readings of classic and contemporary social theory, ethnographic accounts, and diverse research on war, health, and postwar humanitarian interventions, this course will encourage you to build your own critical perspective on war and public health anchored in history and the complexities of real-world situations.",

Our focus will be on human reproduction, considering the vantage points of both healthcare practitioners and lay women and men. We will look at ideas concerning fertility, conception, pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth, birth control, abortion, and assisted reproduction. Because, at a fundamental level, reproduction is about power - as historian Amy Kaler (but by no means only Kaler), pointed out, \"[c]ontrol over human reproduction is eternally contested, in zones ranging from the comparative privacy of the conjugal bedroom to the political platform and programs of national polities\" - we will pay attention to power in reproductive health. And, since the distribution of power in matters of reproduction has often been uneven and unequal - between men and women, between colonizing and Indigenous populations, between clinicians and lay people, between those in upper socioeconomic classes and those in lower socioeconomic classes - we will pay particular attention during this class to struggles over matters of reproduction as we explore historical changes and continuities in reproduction globally since 1900.",

Black bodies, for example, are often the tied to (un)health because they are stereotyped as in need to be controlled, managed, and \"guided\" into healthfulness. In the U.S., these narrow stereotypes are just a few of the ways Black bodies get defined. In this course, we will move beyond those restrictive stereotypes, guided by questions such as, \"How does culture define health?\", \"How does the food pipeline affect the health of certain bodies?\" and \"What does it mean to live in an obesogenic environment?\" In this course, we examine the connection between health, culture, food, and environment with a focus on what is silenced and what is loud when generating \"fixes\" for \"diseased\" bodies. Silence refers to the disregard and dismissiveness of the narratives and experiences around the oppressions attached to the health of certain bodies. Yet, this silence echoes as Loud when connected to their culture, food, and environment when discussing diseases highlighted in Black bodies such as obesity, hypertension, and diabetes.",

The first two weeks cover the meteorology necessary for understanding the local and global systems of atmospheric circulation. This leads to the Koppen climate model which predicts the location of climate types. With climate as a basis, we then turn to the study of soils and vegetation. Soils are strongly influenced by climate and parent material and they vary in their ability to store water and nutrients. Processes of plant growth and decay respond directly to climate and soil productivity which leads to biomass production. All of the biogeographic processes are then used to derive expected patterns of natural vegetation around the world. Local-scale variations are brought in as modifications of the global model. Discrepancies between the predicted and what is actually found in a particular place generally reflect the role of human impacts. Tropical forests, savannas, deserts, grasslands, temperate broadleaf forests, needleleaf boreal forests, and tundra are all interpretable in terms of the physical processes developed in this course.",

The \"region\" refers variously to the Midwest, the state of Illinois, Chicagoland, or just to Chicago and its suburbs. Introductory materials include the kinds of data that have been used to study and describe Chicago. Following that comes the necessary background on the changing physical environment of Chicago since the Pleistocene, including the step-by-step evolution of Lake Michigan. Human groups are traced from prehistory through the Native tribes that inhabited the region at the time of European contact. We will follow the record of land treaties, whereby the Native inhabitants lost their lands, which was followed by land subdivision and land grants made by the U.S. government around 1800.   Chicago grows into a major industrial center during the 19th century which sees a series of shifts in population composition due to migration. The first part of the course ends with the Burnham Plan, which marks a turning point in Chicago history as a major city. The second part of the course traces the themes of 20th century Chicago geography, especially the role of the African American population and the continued arrival of new immigrant groups from Latin America and Asia. Contemporary problems, including racism, suburbanization, depopulation, and changing demographic and economic patterns are the final topics.",

    "ClassOverview": "Thomas Mann was one of the most important twentieth-century writer not only in Germany but also in the broad expanse of world literature.  Though he began his remarkable career as a \"non-political man,\" which actually meant that he was politically conservative, the establishment of the first German democratic state after the First World War and the rise of fascist movements transformed him into a vocal proponent of democratic forms of governance.  This, along with the world-wide fame that came in 1928 with the Nobel Prize for Literature, made him into an enemy of the Nazi regime, from which he fled when, in 1933,  Hitler seized power.  In this class, as we follow Mann's movement from Europe to Los Angeles, where he resided during the Second World War, we ask the following question:  what is the art of political exile?  The major themes of Mann's earlier work had been the relation between eros, death, and the fate of art in the contemporary world.  We will examine how several of the shorter works he wrote in exile reconfigure the connection between mortality, sexuality, gender, the meaning of literature, and the experience of art.  We will also consider where we stand today when we read his work in translation.  And as part of our class, we will visit a major exhibit that will be held in the University Library \"Thomas Mann, Democracy Will Win!\"  No knowledge of German is required.",

This seminar is divided into three parts.  In the first, we will be reading a series of Kafka's shorter writings, ranging from \"The Transformation [Metamorphosis]\" to some fragments about a man who, though dead, sails on the rivers of the earth.  In the second part, we will read three writers who absorbed the exactness of Kafka's imaginary into their own work: Jorge Luis Borges, Ingeborg Bachmann, and J. M. Coetzee.  In the final part, we will return to Kafka, and ask ourselves how we see his writing now that we've encountered some of his most transformative readers.  During the first two parts, students write brief responses to each week's reading; at the end of the second part, students submit an abstract of their final essay; the third part is reserved for the process of essay writing.

In this context we will examine fiction, autobiography, poetry, and political and theoretical writings by and about \"minority voices\" in Germany in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Questions we will explore include: What is the relationship between autobiographical writing and identity? What is a \"minority\" and how might we conceive of a \"minority\" literature in a manner that is critical to identitarian claims of ethnicity, religious belief, gender, and class? What role does \"minority literature\" play in Germany?",

Illness acts as narrative momentum, as a metaphor for social \"ills,\" and as a signifier of tragic virtue in an individual character. Focusing on the 18th and 19th centuries, this class will examine how the tropes of illness in popular literature pertains to our broader cultural assumptions about illness, health, and gender. How do traits associated with femininity resemble literary representations of illness, and vice-versa? How might we locate or analyze femininity in representations of ill men? How do these tropes change over time? What happens if health, rather than illness, becomes a primary marker of virtue? And what does all of this mean for us today? How has the construction of ill femininity been bound up in whiteness, and how has this contributed to systemic and medical racism? What is the relationship between the representation of ill femininity and contemporary \"wellness culture\"\u2014or even contemporary feminism?",

In what ways are contemporary identities such as queer and trans* expansive yet reductive to approach the experiences of Indigenous and Native people across time? This course is an introduction to the study of Indigenous ways of knowing of gender and sexuality in the Americas with a focus on the experiences of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and Two-Spirit (LGBTQ2) individuals. By introducing and relying on concepts such as settler colonialism, decoloniality and coloniality, performativity, and indigeneity, we will build an Indigenous-centered understanding of gender and sexual non-normativity. As we move across several communities and geographical spaces, students will engage first-person accounts, films, short literary texts, performance and art pieces, and theoretical works. This course thoroughly focuses on a handful of representative case studies that will invite students to explore new ones on their own for their final projects. Overall, students will develop writing skills and strategies to read theory in the humanities while expanding their knowledge on gender and sexual minorities beyond western ideas. This course assumes no prior knowledge on gender and sexuality studies or Indigenous studies and offers strong foundation for further study in these fields of knowledge.",

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: Pleasure in the Archives.\"I \ufb01nd myself increasingly insisting on the importance of history, not because things were better (or worse) in an earlier time but because, as cocreators of collective memory, we're all doing it one way and another, and it matters how we tell the story.\"\u2014Finn Enke, \"Collective Memory and the Transfeminist 1970s\" TSQ (2018)In recent years, the \"second wave\" of feminism has increasingly been conflated with \"white, middle-class feminism\" and critiqued as an exclusionary form of feminist politics in contrast to the more intersectional feminist politics of the \"third\" and \"fourth\" waves of feminism. Numerous historians of the period have challenged us to reconsider this claim, which elides \"feminism's deeply questioning, queer, coalitional and anti-imperialist past\" and risks missing \"some ways that feminist, lesbian, and queer of color and trans activists grappled hard to develop critical insights and knowledges that move us today\" (Enke 2018). In this course, we will begin by examining how the \"second wave\" of feminism is being framed in 2021 and explore which projects, groups, and concerns have come to define the \"second wave\" of feminism in the United States in our collective memory. We then turn to recent histories of the \"second wave\" that challenge us to reconsider what counts as \"feminist politics\" during this period. For example, histories that focus on the formation of broad-based coalitions across and between liberation movements around issues of economic justice, reproductive rights, and the right to \"self-defense\" against both state and interpersonal violence during this period, challenge us to expand our conception of feminist activism. In the process, they require us to incorporate the \"critical insights and knowledges\" of labor and welfare rights activists, sex workers and gay liberationists, Black, Chicana, Puerto Rican and Indigenous liberation movement members as central to the feminist politics of the period. As we grapple with the urgencies of the present, what are the politics (and promise) of telling more complex and nuanced stories of activism and social change?",

This course will involve learning about gender as well as applying gender theory. We will study a variety of theoretical approaches to the study of gender, with particular focus on ethnomethodological, post-structural, macro-institutional, and intersectional approaches to the topic. By the end of the term, students will be able to 1) describe and compare theoretical anchors for the study of gender and 2) in writing, demonstrate mastery of two theoretical approaches to gender and apply one theory to a topic of their choosing. Prior course experience in gender/sexuality studies (by way of taking Gender & Society or other course work) is strongly advised.",

In this course, we will engage this work, much of which has been published in the past decade and a half. Course readings, which will survey scholarship on gender/sexuality in many regions of the world, will draw our attention to the ways in which gender/sexuality are implicated in capitalist, imperial and post-colonial projects as well as how gender and sexuality operate outside the \"West,\" both in practice and identity. Finally, we will consider the possibilities and limitations for studying gender/sexuality beyond our own societies. Critical approaches to gender and sexuality challenge conventional \"born this way\" narratives about gender and sexual identities as innate. This course will raise questions that will make us uncomfortable and, hopefully, transform our understandings of our own gendered and sexual identities and practices.",

The use of methodologies like oral history, ethnography and participant observation reflects the lack of written sources on the queer past, but also the political objectives of many researchers - to empower their participants, challenge normativity, and often pursue social change. In this class, we will examine some of the approaches to participatory research, and explore how participatory research might be different in the specific context of queer studies. How is the relationship between researcher and participant altered when both are LGBTQ+ (or assumed to be)? How might queer theory pose a challenge to the activist objectives of participatory research, and vice versa?The central focus of your writing requirements will be your own research paper, on a topic of your choice, putting the participatory research methods we have learned about into practice. We will work on this step by step throughout the quarter, with consistent feedback and support to enable you to become independent researchers.

Sense and Sensibility notoriously pairs its fanciful young heroine with a solemn middle-aged man she admires, but perhaps does not love; Mansfield Park ends with a peaceable marriage between two cousins who received more exciting proposals elsewhere; and even the heroine of Pride and Prejudice\u2014that seeming romance par excellence\u2014only begins to consider the hero as a romantic possibility after seeing his extensive estate. Readers of Jane Austen, know that love\u2014be it affection, admiration, or desire\u2014is never not a complicated emotion. In this class, we will read Austen's works with an eye to investigating how she uses narrative to capture the richness of what were known in the 18th century as \"the passions.\" How do we recognize what we are feeling, and how are these feelings shared\u2014between individuals, or in prose? We will particularly consider Austen's gift for portraying what the critic Sianne Ngai deems \"ugly feelings,\" messy, negative affects like envy, irritation, disgust, and numbness that prove critical to Austen's sharp social commentary. While this class will particularly focus on reading Austen's six novels, as well as some of her juvenilia and her unfinished novel, Sanditon, we will also turn to selections by her contemporaries\u2014including Mary Wollstonecraft, Jane Collier, Phillis Wheatley, and Joanna Baillie\u2014as well as recent film adaptations of her works to further contextualize Austen's view of the passions in light of the period's revolutionary discourse around gender, race, and class.",

Drawing from the overlapping\u2014at times contentious\u2014intellectual frameworks, activist analytics, and genealogies of \"queer and trans of color critique,\" we will interrogate how writers, artists, activists, and performers have labored to enact life worlds in the face of interlocking systems of oppression, such as racial capitalism, cisheteropatriarchy, ableism, and transphobia. Students will have the chance to engage the Chicago area as a site of queer and trans of color worldmaking and activism aimed at imagining a more just and equitable world.",

This course highlights discourses of motherhood that emerge out of women of color feminisms and literary works from the 1980s to the present. I challenge students to read motherhood as a heterogeneous, generative, and at times contradictory relational subject position that allows women of color to challenge white feminism and reclaim their children, both biological and non-biological, from the State that seeks to rupture their relationship. Students will ponder the following questions: how do women of color feminisms complicate and challenge white feminism's concepts of motherhood and its intersection with race, gender, and sexuality? How do labor and care shape the position of the mother? How do literary writers extend and interrogate motherhood as a productive locus to care for others? Each week, the students will read a canonical literary text paired with a theoretical text. For their final assignment, students have the choice to produce a critical or creative work that engages with either or both the literary and theoretical works we have read.",

She has led struggles against privatization and the enclosure of lands and social relations with a specific focus on the commons.  In Nigeria, where she taught for several years in the mid 1980s, she witnessed firsthand the destruction of communal property through the colonial intervention of the World Bank and the IMF.  For her, as a result, the feminist project cannot concern itself exclusively with sexual discrimination, neglecting other political questions.  This graduate seminar explores Federici's understanding of feminism as a history of struggles embedded in other struggles, in constant dialogue with Marxism, antiracism, and environmental politics.  We will assess Federici's criticisms of Marx, Negri, Foucault, Butler, and Haraway while considering her proximity to Vandana Shiva's theory and practice of the commons.  Seminar participants are encouraged to find a way to use Federici's work in their own research projects while exploring anew what Veronica Gago calls \"feminist potential.\"  Keywords: Commons, enclosure, housework, affective labor, the body, ecofeminism, international feminist solidarity.",

The course will investigate the history of feminist approaches to religious studies as well as new directions in current scholarship including black feminist and womanist theologies, goddess feminism, postcolonial and transnational feminisms, and secular and post-secular feminisms. We will consider the following questions: What does it mean to apply a gender studies lens to the study of religion? How do feminist conceptions of \"liberation\" reinforce or reject religious conceptions of \"liberation\"? How does taking religion seriously transform feminist theory? And how does taking feminist theory seriously transform research practices, subjects, archives, and methods in religious studies? In thinking through these topics, we will (re)read some feminist classics as well as focus on a selection of significant recent works important for students of feminist theory and religious studies. This course seeks to move beyond prevalent assumptions of Judeo-Christian normativity in its analysis of feminist contributions to the study of religion. It pays particular attention to feminist approaches to the study of Asian religions, but with flexibility to highlight other geographic/thematic areas of interest to graduate students enrolled in the course.",

Personal computers, HBO, Nike, and Dillo Day all originated in the 1970s, so too the Democratic and Republican parties as we know them. And the 2020s have offered a weird replay, from a failed war to hyper-inflation to impeachment to debates about identity. COVID-19 had no exact parallel, but it resembles the HIV/AIDS crisis that began in 1981 and launched the career of Dr. Anthony Fauci. Joe Biden and Donald Trump also entered public life in the 1970s, as did Bernie Sanders, the Clintons, and George W. Bush.In both decades the existing order proved unsustainable, prompting anxiety, experimentation, debate, and change. This seminar will offer an impressionistic introduction to 1970s politics and culture, less as history than as a two-way mirror onto the present. The class will explore how the past shapes the present and help students to use historical reading, research, writing, and reflection to orient oneself in moments of crisis and uncertainty.

    "ClassOverview": "This course will examine the roots of several aspects of modern American racial thought in British colonial India (ca. 18th-19th centuries).  The words \"thug\" and \"loot,\" for instance, are actually Hindi words that entered the English lexicon through their use by British officials in India, whose deployment of such terms in colonial policing and surveillance of the subject population altered their meaning considerably from the original Hindi.  Similarly, the term \"Aryan\" (so commonly associated with modern Euro-American racial identity and racist ideas) comes from the Sanskrit term \u0101rya, although here too its meaning changed radically in its translation from classical Sanskrit texts into the discourse of Aryanism in modern race science, eugenics, and nationalism (including in India itself).  British colonial ideas have also played a formative role in American foreign policy, whether in terms of controlling the \"tribal\" and \"nomadic\" Native American populations during the westward expansion of the 19th and early 20th centuries, or administering the American colonies in the Philippines (and elsewhere), or, more recently, in the discourse surrounding the so-called \"global war on terror.\" Understanding the British colonial roots of many of these phenomena not only helps us to put American racial thought in a wider global context, but also, one hopes, gives us tools to critique these ideas in the present and try to imagine a better, more tolerant future.",

    "ClassOverview": "It could well be argued that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is as much about history as about land. Just as possession of the Land of Israel/Palestine is contested between Israelis and Palestinians, so the right to that land is contested between the two peoples, and for both sides, it is history that establishes that right, as if conferring a title deed to the country they both claim as their own. Israeli and Palestinian views of history, however, are so different as to be irreconcilable. This course explores this discrepancy, looking at the two peoples' narratives both on their own terms and in relation to one another. How is it, we will ask and answer throughout the course, that the central events in the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are recounted and remembered so differently by the two sides? We will then look at the ways in which Israelis and Palestinians have enlisted history in the service of their cause to vindicate their own right to the land while impeaching that of the other claimant. Accordingly, we will consider the polemical and apologetic dimensions of the two narratives, as we analyze each narrative's omissions, emphases, distortions, trivializations, exaggerations, and appeals to pathos. It will be seen, from our inquiry in this course, that history itself is another battleground in the century-plus-old conflict between Israelis and Palestinians.",

Unlike other history classes, however, its focus isn't on a particular region or country, but on the whole planet. That broad scope will allow us to better understand large-scale phenomena such as empire, industrial technology, communism, the two world wars, HIV/AIDS, and globalization. We'll particularly look at humanity's adoption of fossil fuels, and the prosperity, inequality, and environmental changes that resulted. No prerequisites, and it's fine to take this course before taking 250-1.",

The war also destroyed the British, Dutch, and Japanese empires and vastly strengthened colonial resistance to other imperial powers, transforming South and Southeast Asia, and allowing the United States to play a larger role in Asian affairs, leading to U.S. military involvement in Korea and Vietnam.

This course takes a trans approach to reading gender in the past, with a focus on North America and Europe.How did people in the past understand genders beyond the binary? How did the modern movement for trans rights develop? Can history serve as a resource in fighting anti-trans backlash today? As we seek to answer these questions, we will read academic as well as at medical and sexological texts, political manifestoes, newsletters, memoirs, and zines.Students will finish the class by curating their own virtual exhibition of trans history.",

    "ClassOverview": "This seminar provides an accessible yet in-depth look at the brand of Islamic theorization and activism best known in English as Islamism. We are going to examine the historical origins of that movement (which are not as clear-cut as one might assume), how it changed over time (and why), and how the different ways in which analysts conceive of Islamism inform the value judgements they make about it. Our main geographical focus will be the Middle East, with an emphasis on Egypt, and course materials will include a combination of scholarly works on Islamism and primary sources in translation. The seminar proposes that Islamism represents not the politicization of Islam, as is often claimed, but rather the ideologization of Islam. What that means, and why this is an eminently modern phenomenon, are issues that students will be asked to read, think and write about.",

They have also become an important expression of social anxieties and desires, and an important way to understand the relationship between the individual and the modern state. In this course, we will approach conspiracy narratives and the theories they embody both as symptoms and as modes of knowledge. This module will provide students with the necessary historical and psychological knowledge to understand why these theories formed throughout history and how they have become widespread. The main purpose of this module is to allow students to engage with the society they live as informed and critical thinker individuals. Students will be required to work in small groups and produce a believable conspiracy theory which has to be based on psychological and historical research.",

He was dark-skinned, pierced and tattooed, and he had led the Maya people of Chetumal to war for two decades. But he was also in his own way white, a fellow Spaniard called Gonzalo Guerrero, and his three children, born of marriage with a Maya woman, might be seen as the first Mexicans. The history of Mexico, understood as the country and people that grew from those first contacts, began with that Spaniard in 1511 when his caravel foundered on Scorpion Reef over sixty miles north of the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula.

    "ClassOverview": "Genocide, considered by some scholars \"the crime of crimes\", has received increased attention from diplomats, academics, and the general public since the end of World War II. It has been a major topic in international law, scholarly studies, and debates. The goal of this course is to give students the opportunity to gain wider theoretical and empirical knowledge about several genocides that took place in different parts of the world (North America, Africa, Europe, and Asia), focusing mostly on the twentieth century cases of the Herero Genocide, the Holocaust, and Cambodia. The course will also examine the precursors of twentieth century genocides, by briefly focusing on the destruction of Native Americans during the centuries of European colonization and the persecution of African Americans during the Jim Craw era, which remains some under-researched and much debated topics, with major implications for today's American society. For decades, the Holocaust and the terror of the Khmer Rouge regime (Cambodia) have represented examples of mass atrocity that affected millions of innocent civilians, with the aim of eliminating groups of people in whole or in part. The first genocide of the twentieth century, the destruction of the Herrero and Nama (in present-day Namibia) by the German Imperial Army is a lesser known case of genocide - it was almost forgotten until the boom in mass violence research in the 1990s - and yet crucially important to understand the ways in which the colonial driven destruction of indigenous people continued into the twentieth century and how it influenced the emergence of the Holocaust.In order to provide in-depth explanations and increase knowledge about the character of genocide, one therefore needs to place specific events in their proper historical, cultural, social, political, ideological and other contexts. After completing the course students will acquire solid knowledge about several cases of genocide, with a particular focus on the colonization processes, the growth of nationalist, racist, fascist and communist ideologies during the twentieth century, and the contemporary debates on comparing genocides, prosecution, denial, and prevention.",

    "ClassOverview": "Perhaps the phrase \"the Middle Ages\" calls to mind a period where society was in thrall to a repressive, superstitious church and violence ran rampant: a dark age, indeed. But it might also call to mind Gothic architecture like the Sainte Chapelle in Paris, full of light and exquisite stained glass. Spanning the eleventh to the fifteenth centuries, the High and Late Middle Ages are a study in contradiction. It is a period of both vibrant life and innovative change as well as violence and disillusionment. Cities grew, universities flourished, and new forms of spiritual life helped people engage directly with Christianity. At the same time, the Crusading movement fostered violence against Muslims, Jews, and people who were perceived as heretics. Famine in the early fourteenth century followed by the Black Death dealt suffering across the continent. Misogyny and other forms of discrimination increased as the medieval millennium drew to a close. How did medieval Europeans respond to these tensions and societal changes? We will examine a variety of ways to answer this question by focusing on the cultural history of the period. The course will be divided into thematic units rather than taking a straight chronological approach. Class time will blend lectures and discussion activities designed to allow you to engage with primary sources and \"do history.\" Assignments will be written opportunities to deepen your thinking on course themes and sources; there will be no in-class exams. This class will help you think about how narratives about the past are arguments, as well as how the kinds of sources we use as historians shape the kinds of narratives we can tell.",

Why do Americans consider them too traditional and conservative while Russians and Poles view them as too leftist and liberal? Using contextualization and unique primary sources, this course explores how East European Jews managed to build a robust civilization that lasted over a millennium, how they perceived historical upheavals such as wars, revolutions and pogroms, how they interacted with Christians and Muslims, and how the imperial politics in Russia, Poland, and Austria shaped Jewish identities that continue to frame Jewish mentality. This course traces the itinerary of East European Jews from the times of the medieval Kievan Rus to the early twentieth-century revolutionary upheavals taking a close look at Jews in Poland and the Russian Empire, which also include Lithuania and Ukraine. It challenges cultural myths, provides substantial European context and integrates Jewish history within a framework of a broader imperial and national histories.",

We will explore such topics as the growth of modern urban mass culture, the development of new forms of artistic expression, attempts to ameliorate the status of Chinese women, revolutionary charisma and the effects of political campaigns, the economic and social effects of the Four Modernizations, and the place of the Patriotic Democratic Movement of 1989 in China's long tradition of intellectual and labor protest.",

    "ClassOverview": "When people think of early modern India it it usually the fabled courts of the Mughal Empire, or monuments such as the Taj Mahal, or perhaps romantic portrayals of adventure and derring-do under the British Raj that capture their imagination. But beyond all the glitz and romance, the period from about 1500-1800 was also one of significant transformations in the social, cultural, and political life of the Indian subcontinent. This course will survey some of these developments, begininning with the integration of India's multiple religious, literary, and visual cultures under the Mughal Empire's ideology of \"universal civility\" (sulh-i kull). This policy included the welcoming of European merchants and missionaries who began arriving in the Indian subcontinent during the 16th century; but as Mughal power waned in the 18th century, it faced challenges not only from former client states and regional kingdoms that sought to fill its shoes, but also from the encounter with Europe, particularly the growing military and economic might of the British.  And as the British role in India transitioned from one of mere traders to that of empire-builders with a so-called \"civilizing mission,\" they too would transform the culture and society of India in ways that continue to resonate in South Asian history and cultural memory today.",

    "ClassOverview": "In spite of the moral condemnation by numerous religious, political and intellectual leaders and the massive (national and international) efforts aiming to prevent it, mass violence - in its extreme forms, such as mass murder and genocide affecting groups of people - was and still is a widespread phenomenon in human societies. Recently, numerous scholars have argued that, since the advent of modernity, mass violence has become more murderous, especially during the last century. Its persistence and intensification has triggered a lot of scholarly debates about its origins and nature, particularly how it functions and why so many people got implicated in the violence. This course aims to examine various theories and case studies of extreme mass violence, focusing on the dynamics of group behavior and social, political, economic, gender, and psychological factors that shaped cases of collective violence especially during the twentieth century. The main goal is to discuss various cases of extreme mass violence that targeted entire communities based on their group identity, focusing on the perpetrators and on the various explanations of their murderous behavior and the mechanism of mass violence.",

    "ClassOverview": "This seminar guides students as they research and write the social history of an artifact of their choice. How do our histories read if we organize them around changes in the material world? Do artifacts have politics, and if so, of what sort? In this course, students learn multiple approaches to the study of material culture. We will read exemplary accounts of objects which people have designed, made, sold, bought, gifted, and/or trashed. We will study how these objects came to mediate differences among people, like gender, race, age, nation, and of course, rich and poor. The course offers a well-tested template for conducting, organizing, and writing up your own research on a topic that interests you. Try out an idea for a senior thesis. Research an artifact you love or hate, or feel ambivalent about. Develop a case history of innovation (or obsolescence). The last time the course was offered, students wrote papers on such topics as: the wiretapping of \u201870s radicals, the late nineteenth-century obsession with photographing the dead, how knitting patterns went online, the rise of the labradoodle, the gender dynamics of \u201820s fashion, how changes in intellectual property transformed \u201890s biotech, and why Admiral Grace Hopper programmed COBOL the way she did\u2026.

The final project is a short video about your case study.To develop your research projects, the class foregrounds different methodological approaches: 1) To move beyond journalism, we will conduct primary and secondary historical research to understand the complex historical roots of each case study. 2) We will analyze and practice forms of ethnographic writing to better situate and describe the lived experiences of migration and exile, both past and present. 3) We will pay attention to various forms of media, whether print culture, sound, or visual media, to interrogate but also experiment with contemporary modes of narrating and conveying human experience in the digital age. Our work in class will be collaborative, thus a key prerequisite is that you are mature and self-motivated. You do not need to have prior research experience, but you need to demonstrate a desire to dig into your topic and hone your ability to write deeply informed, rigorous, and nuanced arguments and to think about creative ways to bring rigorous historical and ethnographic detail to visual story-telling. You will be graded on written reading responses, in-class participation, and the final product (a short video, less than five minutes).Students are required to petition for permission to enroll in the class (see instructions in the \"Registration Requirements\" section).",

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: Gender History as Global HistoryIn the past few decades, scholars in the field of global history have challenged others to move beyond the framework of the region or the nation-state. But as many have argued recently, scholars invested in \"thinking big\" about history sometimes have difficulty addressing people who did not move across political boundaries, and they have typically neglected small, ordinary stories and domestic spaces. Since these have been the traditional interests of women's historians, the fields of global and women's history often seem irreconcilable, especially in the era before the twentieth century. One possible solution to this impasse is to deploy the analytical category of gender, which should be able to speak to both fields and across long spans of time. How have historians done this? What does gender history look like on a global scale? In this seminar, we will consider these questions, reading recent work that combines global and gender history in the early modern and modern eras.",

    "ClassOverview": "Refugees/Migration/Exile: A workshop in digital visual storytellingIn this course, students will research a case study from among the many refugee and migration crises that have dominated the news cycle in recent years. The final project is a short video about your case study.To develop your research projects, the class foregrounds different methodological approaches: 1) To move beyond journalism, we will conduct primary and secondary historical research to understand the complex historical roots of each case study. 2) We will analyze and practice forms of ethnographic writing to better situate and describe the lived experiences of migration and exile, both past and present. 3) We will pay attention to various forms of media, whether print culture, sound, or visual media, to interrogate but also experiment with contemporary modes of narrating and conveying human experience in the digital age. Our work in class will be collaborative, thus a key prerequisite is that you are mature and self-motivated. You do not need to have prior research experience, but you need to demonstrate a desire to dig into your topic and hone your ability to write deeply informed, rigorous, and nuanced arguments and to think about creative ways to bring rigorous historical and ethnographic detail to visual story-telling. You will be graded on written reading responses, in-class participation, and the final product (a short video, less than five minutes).Students are required to petition for permission to enroll in the class (see instructions in the \"Registration Requirements\" section). *Counts towards Religion, Law and Politics (RLP) and Religion, Sexuality and Gender (RSG) religious studies major concentrations.",

    "ClassOverview": "The Philosophy of Punishment and IncarcerationThe United States is currently home to 5% of the world's population, but 25% of its incarcerated population. With more than 2.3 million people under the control of the American criminal legal system, the United States has more total people who are incarcerated than any other country in the world. Moreover, the United States has one of the most punitive approaches to criminal justice, imposing lengthy prison sentences, forcing people who are incarcerated to spend years\u2014sometimes even decades\u2014in solitary confinement, and providing very few educational, vocational, and recreational programs in prisons.Punishment and incarceration also disproportionately impact people of color. Black Americans are incarcerated at more than 5 times the rate of whites. While Black Americans and Hispanics make up about 32% of the US population, they constitute 56% of the incarcerated population.This course will use a philosophical lens to examine the causes and consequences of this crisis of mass incarceration in the United States, along with possible solutions to it, with a particular emphasis on the theories of punishment grounding our criminal legal system and, thus, our prisons. The course will be small and will have a seminar-style format. Enrollment will include both Northwestern students from the Evanston campus and students in the Northwestern Prison Education Program.",

    "ClassOverview": "Black Women on the Musical StageThis course engages the performances of Black women on the US musical stage from 1900 to 1970, focusing on singer-actresses and their vocal sound. Under the capacious vaudeville tent or proscenium arch of musical theatre belting, how did the blues shouter's sound influence the Broadway belter's technique? How were these sounds carried forward by Black torch singers and character actresses, nightclub vocalists, television variety performers, and Black Broadway glamour girls? Drawing on the work of scholars Shane Vogel and Daphne Brooks, we will read performers' autobiographies as performance theory and understand Black women singers as skillful arrangers of sound-voice teachers whose varied \"singing lessons\" function as vibrant scenarios for performance analysis. Our studies will take seriously what Sissieretta Jones, Bessie Smith, Ethel Waters, Pearl Bailey, Juanita Hall, Lena Horne, Diahann Carroll, Leslie Uggams, and Eartha Kitt have had to say and teach about singing on the musical stage.NOTE: Enrollment in this course will be limited to upper-level undergrads (juniors and seniors) and grad students (MFA and PhD).

    "ClassOverview": "The Crime Centered DocumentaryIn this course, we will view non-fiction and hybrid films that revolve around crime, criminal justice, and criminal court cases. Our emphasis will be on cases that are either mired in controversy or emblematic of wider social concerns. Readings will augment viewings as we weigh legal, philosophical, or scientific perspectives: What is accurately depicted? What is omitted? What is misrepresented? Concurrently, we will investigate the films aesthetically: How is the film structured and why? What choices are being made by the filmmaker regarding camera, sound, and editing, and how do these choices affect viewers? Throughout the course, we will consider the ethics of depicting real people and traumatic events. We will also look at specific films in regard to their legal or societal impact.Assignments will include a series of short response papers and a substantial final project, which can take the form of either (up to the student) a ten- to twelve-page paper or a six- to twelve-minute film/podcast/media project. Projects should center upon a legal topic. Ideas include, but are not limited to, a paper that compares two films depicting the same criminal case or a polished/edited film interview with an individual connected to a crime or involved with the legal system (a defendant, a lawyer, a judge, a policeperson, etc.). Additional topics could center around mitigation films, viral crime videos, local courts, legal advocacy centers, or hybrid crime films.Notes:Attendance at first class is required unless cleared by the professor.For students who have not completed RTVF 190, if you choose to make a film or podcast for your final project, you must have access to equipment and editing software.Students must strictly adhere to RTVF Production Handbook and Covid Best Practice guidelines: https://communication.northwestern.edu/radio-television-film/for-current-rtvf-students/.Technical skills such as lighting, camera, sound, and editing will not be taught in this class.Group projects (two people max) will be allowed.",

    "ClassOverview": "In a time of growing awareness of severe environmental crisis, how do artists (and how do we) make change while avoiding despair? This class focuses on ways artists and activists who are motivated by ecological concerns, but also by optimism about the difference they can make, have adapted artistic strategies to address environmental issues over the course of recent decades. Blurring the boundary between art and activism, or art and environmental remediation, they have taken up themes of sustainability and materiality, \"collaborated\" with natural processes, and addressed crises from industrial toxins to global warming. In this course we address key themes in environmental art, considering art, ecology, and politics in relation to issues that include gender, race, poverty, territory, and indigeneity. The course will unfold in conjunction with a performance and class visit by a Kaplan artist in residence and will also involve one or more field trips. Along with class participation and periodic short writing assignments, work will include group and individual final projects.",

Storytelling has been a staple of Italian literature and culture since the days of Boccaccio, but the aesthetic, ethical, and cultural aspects of the genre certainly have changed in the last century. Can the modern short story still communicate ethical and social truths? Is the inherent, conclusive brevity and elegance of the genre paradoxically better able to capture the chaos of contemporary life?We will examine works written in a realistic mode and in a fantastic style. Moreover, we will discuss the elements that define the two approaches with an emphasis on close reading and on the historical and social context of each text. We will focus in particular on issues of love, jealousy, sexuality, gender, friendship and youth culture as defined by Boccaccio, Verga, Morante, Ortese, Pavese, Calvino, Tabucchi and Tondelli.",

What are the aesthetic bases of modernist literature?   How did writers and artists respond to contemporary political trends such as Marxism, feminism, imperialism, and nationalism?  In what ways did modernist works reflect rapidly changing conceptions of space, time, and self in the early to mid-20th Century?

    "ClassOverview": "Whether as a dangerous rival of traditional Jewish life or the only escape from the cruel, alienated modern world, love has always been a preoccupation in modern - and post-modern - Hebrew literature and culture. This course seeks to observe the various depictions of the notion of \"love\" from the early 20th century onwards, as captured in Hebrew novels, short stories, films, and other cultural representations. What stories do Hebrew and Israeli culture tell us about love? What kinds of love (and sexualities) does it portray? And why does it seem that even the greatest love stories must be painful and complicated? The eruption of love and its decline; the excitement of desire revealing itself and the disappointment in the (inevitable?) failure that follows; the diasporic Jewish men's complex attitude toward Eros and the suffering of the abandoned wives of the shtetl; the gendered roles and the queer alternatives; the excitement, the anticipation, the pain and the melancholy - these are some of the themes that the course will explore. During the course we will read literary texts from Shmuel Yosef Agnon, Yosef Haim Brenner, Dvora Baron, Yehudit Hendel, Orly Castel-Bloom, Alon Hilu and others. We will also watch some recent Israeli films/TV shows. The literary discussions will be accompanied by relevant theoretical texts. No previous knowledge of Hebrew, Israel or Judaism is required!

We will discuss Nazi ideology; the complex interface between the Nazi regime's espousal of racism and the motivation of perpetrators on the ground; the interface between politics and law; the victims' reactions to persecution; conditions of life in the ghettos and camps; the response of the international community; the complex question of the role of 'collaborators,' 'bystanders,' 'beneficiaries'; and the aftermath of the war. In the second part of the course, we will examine the contradicting attitudes of Israeli society towards the Holocaust. We will probe how the establishment of the State of Israel, the 1950's mass immigration, and the evolving Arab-Israeli conflict shaped Israeli's understanding and memory of the Holocaust.

Israeli and Palestinian views of history, however, are so different as to be irreconcilable. This course explores this discrepancy, looking at the two peoples' narratives both on their own terms and in relation to one another. How is it, we will ask and answer throughout the course, that the central events in the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are recounted and remembered so differently by the two sides? We will then look at the ways in which Israelis and Palestinians have enlisted history in the service of their cause to vindicate their own right to the land while impeaching that of the other claimant. Accordingly, we will consider the polemical and apologetic dimensions of the two narratives, as we analyze each narrative's omissions, emphases, distortions, trivializations, exaggerations, and appeals to pathos. It will be seen, from our inquiry in this course, that history itself is another battleground in the century-plus-old conflict between Israelis and Palestinians.",

The class will consider documentary and narrative films focusing on genocides. The aim of the course is to understand how telling these stories in different registers offers diverse ways of understanding what happened. We will pay particular attention to the distinctive points of view and entr\u00e9es to historical events afforded by various genres and modes of cinematic narration. The first part of the class will be devoted to films dealing with the World War II European Holocaust. The last four weeks will consider films representing other historic genocides: Armenian, Cambodian, Rwandan, and Yugoslav.Class time will be devoted to screenings and discussion of the films in the context of reading assignments, supplemented by brief lectures on cinematic narration/point of view. In addition, each student will develop a research project, culminating in a final paper. These can address films that deal with other genocides or extend the range of films connected to those covered in the class.Course Work: In addition to the individual research project mentioned above, students will be asked to come to class with brief notes on things they found particularly interesting in the reading and screening material.",

They did so in four main stages:  (1) First there were writers of late antiquity who were in direct continuity with classical Latin tradition and gave it Christian inflection.  (2) Then there were Carolingian writers of (roughly) the 9th century who, having become aware of a distinction between Latin and the emerging Romance languages, self-consciously sought to revive classical language and literature.  (3) Twelfth-century poets experimented with new forms but were deeply conscious of what they viewed nostalgically as the lost culture of Latin antiquity.  (4) Humanist writers of the fourteenth through sixteenth centuries, beginning in Italy, self-consciously reasserted what they viewed as classical alternatives to Scholastic and other recent trends.  Apart from self-conscious revivals of classical Latin culture, there was what might be called simply survival of early literary tradition; in early medieval England, for example, standards of Latin learning remained high, and authors who built on classical sources did so in a spirit more of continuity than of revival.",

    "ClassOverview": "What role has archaeology played in the emergence and consolidation of modern nation-states in the Americas? Across the world, states use monuments and archaeological artifacts to present national narratives in museums, ancient sites, and online platforms. In the Americas, nation-states have controlled who has access to the material remains from the past while transforming buildings, historic places, monuments, and artifacts into national patrimony. In the process of creating national patrimony, nation-states often estrange Indigenous communities from their landscapes and their cultural heritage. In this course, we will examine the role of archaeology in the creation and preservation of national identities in the Americas from the 18th century to the present. In weekly readings and discussions, we will learn about the institutionalization of archaeology as a state-sponsored discipline, the development of archaeological sites as national monuments and tourist destinations, the display and interpretation of artifacts in museums and heritage sites, and the monopolization of tangible cultural heritage by the state. Ultimately, we will evaluate the intersections of identity and politics throughout the history of the Americas.",

Our work in class will be collaborative, thus a key prerequisite is that you are mature and self-motivated. You do not need to have prior research experience, but you need to demonstrate a desire to dig into your topic and hone your ability to write deeply informed, rigorous, and nuanced arguments and to think about creative ways to bring that rigorous detail to visual story-telling. Students are required to petition for permission to enroll in the class (see instructions in the \"Registration Requirements\" section). *Counts towards Religion, Law and Politics (RLP) and Religion, Sexuality and Gender (RSG) religious studies major concentrations.",

He was dark-skinned, pierced and tattooed, and he had led the Maya people of Chetumal to war for two decades. But he was also in his own way white, a fellow Spaniard called Gonzalo Guerrero, and his three children, born of marriage with a Maya woman, might be seen as the first Mexicans. The history of Mexico, understood as the country and people that grew from those first contacts, began with that Spaniard in 1511 when his caravel foundered on Scorpion Reef over sixty miles north of the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula. This course traces that history from the beginning until the present.",

Our emphasis will be on cases that are either mired in controversy and/or emblematic of wider social concerns. Readings will accompany viewings and experts will weigh in with legal, philosophical or scientific perspectives: What is accurately depicted? What is omitted? What is misrepresented? Concurrently, we will investigate the films aesthetically: How is the film structured and why? What choices are being made by the filmmaker in terms of camera, sound and editing and how do these choices affect viewers? Throughout the course, we will consider the ethics of depicting real people and traumatic events. We will also look at specific films in regard to their legal or societal impact.Assignments will include a series of short response papers and a substantial final project, which can take the form of either (up to the student) a 10-12 page paper or an 6-12 minute film/podcast/media project. Projects should center upon a legal topic. Ideas include, but are not limited to, a paper that compares two films depicting the same criminal case or a polished/edited film interview with an individual connected to a crime or involved with the legal system (a defendant, a lawyer, a judge, a policeperson, etc.). Additional topics could center around mitigation films, viral crime videos, local courts, legal advocacy centers, or hybrid crime films.",

Which aspects of the human capacity for language are best understood as biological, as species-wide and species-specific? How do families, schools, and communities help shape children's development as speakers and listeners, and eventually as readers and writers? How does learning a first language (or more than one language) interact with learning to think, learning to imagine, and developing a sense of identity? To explore these questions, we will consider studies of children's language development along with perspectives from social policy, medicine, law, education, business and marketing, television, theatre, film, music, and children's book publishing.

    "ClassOverview": "This course focuses on developing the communication skills necessary for academic presentations at a graduate level. Students will work on improving their delivery of oral presentations to large groups using PowerPoint and other visual aids, as well as their ability to effectively communicate academic concepts to smaller groups and individuals. Over the course of the class, students will also have considerable opportunities to improve their sociolinguistic and strategic competence, as well as practice American English pronunciation, stress, and intonation patterns. The class will be focused on the observation, creation, and practice of multiple academic presentations. Active participation and evidence of progress towards proficiency must be demonstrated in order to achieve a satisfactory grade in the course. Work on these skills will be helpful to students in a variety of academic contexts, including making class presentations, reporting on research at lab meetings, engaging in job interviews, and presenting papers and posters at conferences and colloquia. Work in this class will also hone skills applicable to teaching positions, such as giving lectures, leading discussion sections or lab sections, and interacting with American undergraduates.",

The goal of the course is to give students the tools to improve their intelligibility and effectiveness when communicating in English, with an emphasis on communication in the American academic context.  Students will discuss and practice strategies for making individual and group presentations, reporting on written information, narrating in the past and future timeframes, working with small groups, writing email, and networking at professional events. We will develop these skills through a quarter-long group project where students will set up, conduct, and report on an interview with a member of the Northwestern community.  Along the way, we will review the sound structure of English with a goal of improved pronunciation and fluency.  Students will have an opportunity to consider their own oral English proficiency in light of proficiency assessments used at Northwestern, and will receive feedback on the Versant test performance as well as practice Versant sessions.",

One of the main goals of this course will be a classification of quadratic forms over Q, originally due to Minkowski. Along the way, we will introduce fundamental concepts like the p-adic numbers, quadratic reciprocity, and the Riemann zeta function and prove other number theoretic results such as Lagrange's four-square theorem and Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions. Other topics can be covered depending on student interests (for example, we could go further with analytic methods).Prerequisites: Math 331-3. No previous experience with number theory is assumed.",

    "ClassOverview": "It could well be argued that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is as much about history as about land. Just as possession of the Land of Israel/Palestine is contested between Israelis and Palestinians, so the right to that land is contested between the two peoples, and for both sides, it is history that establishes that right, as if conferring a title deed to the country they both claim as their own. Israeli and Palestinian views of history, however, are so different as to be irreconcilable. This course explores this discrepancy, looking at the two peoples' narratives both on their own terms and in relation to one another. How is it, we will ask and answer throughout the course, that the central events in the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are recounted and remembered so differently by the two sides? We will then look at the ways in which Israelis and Palestinians have enlisted history in the service of their cause to vindicate their own right to the land while impeaching that of the other claimant. Accordingly, we will consider the polemical and apologetic dimensions of the two narratives, as we analyze each narrative's omissions, emphases, distortions, trivializations, exaggerations, and appeals to pathos. It will be seen, from our inquiry in this course, that history itself is another battleground in the century-plus-old conflict between Israelis and Palestinians.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course introduces Islam, one of the major religious traditions of world history. We will develop a framework for understanding how Muslims in varying times and places have engaged with Islamic scripture and the prophetic message of the Prophet Muhammad through diverse sources: theological, philosophical, legal, political, mystical, literary and artistic. While we aim to grasp broad currents and narratives of Islamic history, we will especially concentrate on the origins and development of the religion in its formative period (the prophetic career of the Prophet Muhammad, the Qur\\'an, Islamic belief and ritual, Islamic law, mysticism, and popular spirituality) and debates surrounding Islam in the contemporary world (the impact of European colonialism on the Muslim world, the rise of the modern Muslim state, women\\'s experiences, and the rise of jihadi activism in the late twentieth century).",

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: Modern Jewish Literature: Love Stories in Hebrew LiteratureWhether as a dangerous rival of traditional Jewish life or the only escape from the cruel, alienated modern world, love has always been a preoccupation in modern - and post-modern - Hebrew literature and culture. This course seeks to observe the various depictions of the notion of \"love\" from the early 20th century onwards, as captured in Hebrew novels, short stories, films, and other cultural representations. What stories do Hebrew and Israeli culture tell us about love? What kinds of love (and sexualities) does it portray? And why does it seem that even the greatest love stories must be painful and complicated? The eruption of love and its decline; the excitement of desire revealing itself and the disappointment in the (inevitable?) failure that follows; the diasporic Jewish men's complex attitude toward Eros and the suffering of the abandoned wives of the shtetl; the gendered roles and the queer alternatives; the excitement, the anticipation, the pain and the melancholy - these are some of the themes that the course will explore. During the course we will read literary texts from Shmuel Yosef Agnon, Yosef Haim Brenner, Dvora Baron, Yehudit Hendel, Orly Castel-Bloom, Alon Hilu and others. We will also watch some recent Israeli films/TV shows. The literary discussions will be accompanied by relevant theoretical texts. No previous knowledge of Hebrew, Israel or Judaism is required! All the Hebrew prose texts will be read in translation.",

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: Ottoman & Qajar Photography in the Age of Orientalism, 1839-1914From the first announcement of its invention in 1839, photography was linked with the Middle East, where it immediately became a tool of European imperialism in the Ottoman Empire and Qajar Iran. In the nineteenth century, photography served Europe's pictorial transformation of the Ottoman and Qajar worlds into the imaginary \"Orient,\" characterized by backwards spirituality, perverse sexuality, and violent tyranny (hence ripe for European intervention). At the same time, photography was also taken up by a wide array Ottoman and Qajar subjects\u2014from sultans and shahs to artists, scholars, and the Muslim middle classes\u2014who adapted photography's powers to their own ends. This course traces the impacts of Ottoman and Qajar culture, politics, and social history on photography's development as a technology of representation in the nineteenth century. By focusing on photography's entangled history with European colonialism in the Middle East and North Africa, this course highlights Orientalism as both a source of inspiration and a site of contestation for Ottoman and Qajar photographers (and their subjects). The course examines a wide range of photographic genres, including royal portraiture, studio photography, ethnographic photography, and archaeological photography, as well as the many fascinating processes and materials of nineteenth-century photography, from the daguerreotype to photolithography.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course focuses on the notion of the other in modern Turkish fiction from the early 20th century to nearly the present. The other can signify any categorization (based on differences in culture, ethnicity, religion, politics, gender, origin, social status, etc.) that individuals see as an anomaly or threat to their own established values and practices. Turkish literature, like any literature, teems with characters, themes, and narratives that portray and deal with the other, which also evokes the notion of identity. In short, this course deals with the way in which individuals see themselves and others in Turkish fiction. The questions one can ask are as follows: How and why characters treat each other as others? What problems does othering lead to? Do characters see othering as a problem at all? Do they take a step toward a solution? What is the author's position in and reaction to the othering portrayed in their work? Does the author see this as a perennial question, or to they treat this a problem that can be easily surmounted?",

    "ClassOverview": "NEUROSCI 202-0 introduces students to the cellular and molecular processes that allow the nervous system to produce behavior, with a focus on how electrochemical signals are generated, communicated and integrated to transform different sensations into appropriate actions. We all want to know how the mind works in health and what happens when things go wrong in disease. However, first we need to start with the fundamentals, which this course will provide. Learning about neuroscience is like learning a new language, which will require the introduction of new words and the memorization of terminology. Students will be expected to increase their vocabulary so that they can begin to appreciate and discuss neuroscience concepts and research in an informed manner. This is not a survey course, rather it is designed to provide a solid foundation for subsequent coursework that delves more deeply into various topics in neuroscience.Prerequisites: Must be a neuroscience major, and BIOL_SC 201-0 and either; CHEM 132-0 or co-enrollment in CHEM 152-0 or CHEM 172-0.Course content is divided into three sections. The first third focuses on the ionic and molecular basis of  generating electric signals in neurons. The second third focuses on electrical and chemical communication between neurons, how these connections are adjusted, and how they develop. The final third focuses on simple circuits that illustrate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that allow us to taste, smell, see, hear, feel and move.NEUROSCI 202-0 will be offered again Fall 2023 and Winter 2024.",

As organisms move through their lives, however, they must navigate thepresent moment by anticipating the future. In other words, they must engage inprediction. Brains have many mechanisms and strategies for formulating and actingon predictions, on time scales ranging from sub-seconds to years. Indeed, it is thebrain's attempts at prediction, successful and unsuccessful, that underlie many of thecomplex questions of interest to neuroscience and the larger society. This course willtake a cellular neurophysiological approach to examining neural mechanisms ofprediction\u2014i.e., how different brain circuits operating at different time scalescontribute to attributing cause and anticipating effect. We will discuss logic (\"truthtables\") in the brain, probability, variance, accuracy of sensations, aversion andreward, time perception, pattern completion, and decision circuits, with a goal ofgaining perspective on some of the \"big questions,\" including superstition, aesthetics,and humor.

Our nervous system is able to integrate and react to an ever-changing environment because of the existence of very specialized sensory cells throughout the body that detect external stimuli. Signals are then relayed to the brain where they allow us to perceive, interpret, and respond to sights, sounds, tastes, smells, touch, and pain.

What does it take for a given theory to be better supported by the available evidence than its competitors?

What does it take for an explanatory scientific theory to be credited with reference to underlying structures of reality?

The seminar will also relate Kant's arguments to issues in more recent philosophical debates. E.g.: Kant qualified his philosophy as \"transcendental idealism and empirical realism\". According to Kant, it evades the choice between saying that we must have an unconceptualized access to reality in order to have factual knowledge (so that it is hard to say how we as concept-using knowers can know reality at all) on the one hand, and saying that the reality our factual knowledge represents is determined by our concepts (so that it is hard to say in what way reality is a mind-independent constraint on belief). Kant suggests that this is a non-issue if there is only one universal set of concepts constitutive of all (genuinely fact-enabling) human experience. But the course of scientific progress since reveals this as a big (and unfulfilled) IF: in light of the diversity of experience and of the sciences, it is not easy to insist that there is only one set of forms of all possible objects of experience, one set of categories to form judgments, one set of principles to form natural laws. But the impasse confronted in Kant's epistemological analysis persists --for each of the variegated forms. Can Kant's conception of experience and empirical knowledge still help us understand how we can claim to know mind-independent reality? Another example: Much of contemporary philosophy of mind centers on the question of the relation between mind and reality. Kant criticized all such attempts at founding factual knowledge on self-knowledge (which lead into \"paralogisms\") or knowledge of unconceptualised reality in itself (which lead to \"antinomies\"). His arguments compel realizing that both (reality as such and a directly present foundational 'inner' self) can't be objects of knowledge at all (=are non-objects).

We will foreground the aspects of Foucault's approach that have most impacted inquiry and critique in the arts, humanities, and social sciences. We will give special attention to the fields of gender and sexuality studies, and Black studies as contexts of uptake, criticism, and revision of Foucauldian concepts. Thematically, the course will focus on Foucault's writings on sexuality, madness, health, prisons, delinquency, families, power, biopolitics, surveillance, selfhood and individuality, knowledge, and truth. Conceptually, we'll debate and apply core Foucauldian concepts such as:  archaeology and genealogy; discipline and biopower, the productivity and plurality of power; normalization and its dependence on \"abnormality;\" the conditions under which freedom is also a form of \"subjection\"; the carceral society, the possibilities of social resistance and transformation; the historical a priori; and epistemic rupture.   We'll critically assess the contribution of Foucault's major works (focusing on History of Madness, Discipline and Punish, and History of Sexuality). The course is reading intensive- students will read  a) weekly excerpts by Foucault; b) their own choice of one work by Foucault as the basis of their final paper (a number of options are extensively discussed in class), and c) at least one extra chapter or article by a contemporary critic (many options are provided).

In the third and final part of the course, we turn to the growing field of public health ethics, public health being concerned with the promotion of health at the population level rather than with the provision of personal health care services. We will look at prominent recent accounts of the moral foundations and limits of public health.Juniors and Seniors only",

    "ClassOverview": "To speak a language is to have the ability to describe. But what is the limit of this ability? A recurring theme in the history of philosophy is that certain topics are beyond language. These topics are said to be ineffable  because describing them is somehow beyond our ability. Examples of such topics include God, sensory experience, and nothingness. In this class, we will focus on understanding how a topic could be ineffable. To do so, we will read both historical philosophy from Eastern and Western traditions and contemporary work from both analytic philosophy and linguistics.Instructor consent only.",

    "ClassOverview": "The United States is currently home to 5% of the world's population, but 25% of its incarcerated population. With more than 2.3 million people under the control of the American criminal legal system, the United States has more total people who are incarcerated than any other country in the world. Moreover, the United States has one of the most punitive approaches to criminal justice, imposing lengthy prison sentences, forcing people who are incarcerated to spend years\u2014sometimes even decades\u2014in solitary confinement, and providing very few educational, vocational, and recreational programs in prisons. Punishment and incarceration also disproportionately impact people of color. Black Americans are incarcerated at more than 5 times the rate of whites. While Black Americans and Hispanics make up about 32% of the US population, they constitute 56% of the incarcerated population. This course will use a philosophical lens to examine the causes and consequences of this crisis of mass incarceration in the United States, along with possible solutions to it, with a particular emphasis on the theories of punishment grounding our criminal legal system and, thus, our prisons. The course will have a seminar-style format and will be held at Stateville Correctional Center in Crest Hill, IL.",

We will analyze the distinctive institutional proposals that each of these conceptions offer to help address the many problems that afflict democratic societies. A central question to discuss in the seminar will be the extent to which these proposals could help societies overcome their current democratic deficits or whether they might actually add to the trend of democratic deconsolidation that we are witnessing everywhere and that threatens the future of democracy as we know it.",

However, Richard Delgado tells us that: \"Unlike traditional civil rights discourse, which stresses incrementalism and step-by-step progress, critical race theory questions the very foundations of the liberal order, including equality theory, legal reasoning, Enlightenment rationalism, and neutral principles of constitutional law.\" This graduate seminar will explore the foundations and central tenets of Critical Race Theory, from its origins in Critical Legal Studies, to current applications and debates with particular attention to Critical Race Theory's intersections with the field of Philosophy. We will apply philosophical lenses to this legal theory's understanding of itself, law, and our world.",

    "ClassOverview": "A radio and an optical astronomer go into a bar to resolve their disagreement about the nature ofthe visible and invisible universe (see the cartoon). This course discusses the way radio and opticalastronomers view the sky with their respective telescopes. In particular, the realm of the invisiblewhich includes the components of a radio telescope, the fascinating history of radio astronomy, andthe numerous discoveries over the last 90 years (e.g., pulsars, quasars, cosmic microwave backgroundradiation, organic molecules).Before 1931, the study of the universe was limited to optical observations of the night sky. KarlJansky changed everything by building a radio telescope that could observe the sky day or night.We are all familiar with radio frequencies by listening to FM radio stations and using GPS satellitesfor navigation. Radio astronomy is the study of natural radio emission from celestial objects atfrequencies outside FM and GPS frequencies. The human eye can see optical light but is blindto radio signals, including those that provide important clues about the history of our universe.The radio band is very broad, spanning 100,000 Hz between 107 to 1012 Hz, whereas our eyes areonly sensitive between red and blue, a factor of two. This course discusses new tools to unveil the`hidden' sky over a wide range of frequencies in ways that can not be viewed or understood in theoptical frequencies.",

The class crosses between political science and legal scholarship and draws cases, readings, and debates from both. The seminar also invests in cultivating research skills and critical thinking.

    "ClassOverview": "It is reasonable to assume that most of us owe (or will at some point owe) money to creditors from whom we've borrowed funds. Debt is a pervasive feature of financial life in the United States: many people have outstanding (and sometimes large) debts in the form of student loans, credit card bills, open lines of credit with banks, or home mortgages. The U.S. government has also built up an impressively large debt load over the past seventy years. (Currently topping $28 trillion, or around 130% of total U.S. gross domestic product. Which is to say: the U.S. federal government owes a lot of money to a lot of creditors.) But while debt touches most people's lives in some fashion, the complex history and politics of modern debtor-lender relations remains, for most, essentially unknown territory. The central purpose of this course, then, is to deepen our understanding of how we got to this point. How did debt - both private and public - swell to current levels? How were markets for debt built? What were the politics of some key turning points in the history of US government debt? How do gendered and racialized differences in the terms of access to credit produce and reinforce social inequalities? When do debt markets break down and how do societies recover from debt crises? Under what conditions are debts honored and when can (and should) debt contracts be repudiated? Should we be worried about the big increases in many countries' debt loads in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic?",

    "ClassOverview": "In this course we will analyze canonical political theoretical texts in conversation with contemporary U.S. jurisprudence and politics, paying special attention to themes of sovereignty, nationalism, war, the rule of law, speech, sex, race, religion, and resistance. The objective is for students to acquire the knowledge and competencies of a responsible citizen. This means that you should leave this class with the ability to think, write, and speak about political theories and their relation to laws and legal obligations, as well as strategies for supporting, challenging, or resisting prevailing political intuitions and their institutionalization. You should be able to understand and defend your own interpretations of political conflicts, violence, and law. To do so will require you to become familiar with key historical events relevant to contemporary debates about the rule of law, speech, and religion, to which much of the lectures will be devoted. Assigned readings include works by Plato, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Karl Marx, John Stuart Mill, Rosa Luxemburg, Frantz Fanon, and Carole Pateman. Please note: this class requires you read about 100 pages of political theory weekly, on average. This is a course for those who enjoy reading and discussing challenging texts. The authors assigned for this class wrote in very different times and contexts, and had different political priorities. Each week please reflect on whether the author's objective is a state with a primary goal of institutionalizing ideas about nationality; a state with the overriding objective of institutionalizing justice, or thwarting injustice; or a state whose power is instrumental to protecting individuals' safety, property, or flourishing. Which author's commitments and aspirations do you find most inspiring and most objectionable?",

    "ClassOverview": "In this course we will analyze canonical political theoretical texts in conversation with contemporary U.S. jurisprudence and politics, paying special attention to themes of sovereignty, nationalism, war, the rule of law, speech, sex, race, religion, and resistance. The objective is for students to acquire the knowledge and competencies of a responsible citizen. This means that you should leave this class with the ability to think, write, and speak about political theories and their relation to laws and legal obligations, as well as strategies for supporting, challenging, or resisting prevailing political intuitions and their institutionalization. You should be able to understand and defend your own interpretations of political conflicts, violence, and law. To do so will require you to become familiar with key historical events relevant to contemporary debates about the rule of law, speech, and religion, to which much of the lectures will be devoted. Assigned readings include works by Plato, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Karl Marx, John Stuart Mill, Rosa Luxemburg, Frantz Fanon, and Carole Pateman. Please note: this class requires you read about 100 pages of political theory weekly, on average. This is a course for those who enjoy reading and discussing challenging texts. The authors assigned for this class wrote in very different times and contexts, and had different political priorities. Each week please reflect on whether the author's objective is a state with a primary goal of institutionalizing ideas about nationality; a state with the overriding objective of institutionalizing justice, or thwarting injustice; or a state whose power is instrumental to protecting individuals' safety, property, or flourishing. Which author's commitments and aspirations do you find most inspiring and most objectionable?",

The history includes the practice of banishment in ancient Greece and Rome; the destruction by European conquistadors and explorers of long-settled communities in the Americas; the forced transport of \"masterless men\" from England to the colonies; the banishment of Americans of so-called African, Mexican, and Asian descent from their homes and communities; European resettlement policies for national minorities following World War One; the \"destruction of the European Jews\"; and 20th and 21st century deportations in Europe and the United States and their effects elsewhere. The course will devote attention to theories of the family and intergenerational identities that animate attachments to race and nationality, as well as comparisons among deportation policies in different regions and epochs. Students will be required to listen to actual immigration hearings and write their analyses of two of these.Students must be able to observe at least three hours of immigration court hearings in downtown Chicago. The hearings are typically M-Th and start at 9 a.m. Professor will make information on observations available, but it is the responsibility of the student to go to court and complete the required observations.",

We will focus on the political experiences of America's three largest groups of Latino-origin: Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Cuban Americans.The first part of the course will examine the social construction of Latino identities and trace the historical experiences of all three groups, comparing the elements behind each group's migration and how those processes affect their incorporation in mainstream society. We also examine demographic resources and the impact of immigration on the politics of the Latino collective. Next, we turn to the development of a Latino politics, placing special emphasis on political attitudes, mobilization strategies and electoral participation. Lastly, we tackle public policy issues such as voting rights and language policy.The question that we will return to throughout the course is the degree to which and under what circumstances it is appropriate to speak of a Latino community.",

Topics covered include the relationship between democracy and development, the role of the state, consequences of natural resources and corruption, and the impact of foreign aid. Lectures and readings will include examples from various countries around the world. We will also explore such conceptual areas as gender, the environment, ethnicity, and war and examine how they apply to developing countries and their development processes. To make these concepts more tangible, we will draw examples from several cases including China, Brazil, Mexico, Sierra Leone and Malaysia.

    "ClassOverview": "The election of Barack Obama, the country's first Black president, marked a significant watershed in American race relations. His presidency prompted heady expectations for greater racial tolerance and inclusion, but also fueled grim worries about racial backlash and conflict. The contest to select a new president, following Obama's two terms, and the victory of Donald Trump amplified the concerns about deepening racial divisions in the country. How could the same nation that elected Obama immediately elect Trump? This is the animating paradox we explore in this seminar. The course examines shifts in American racial politics during the Obama and Trump presidencies. We will consider each president's vision of the country's troubled racial history and ongoing racial challenges, juxtaposing Obama's aspirational appeal to multiracial democracy with Trump's stoking of racial grievance. Our survey will take stock of Blacks' political fortunes, racial attitudes across groups, reactions to demographic and economic change, and racial dynamics in party politics and public policies over the course of these two consequential presidencies. By the end of the course, students should have, at a minimum, a deeper, more fine-grained understanding of racial dynamics in American politics in the wake of these two historic presidencies. The more ambitious aim of the seminar is to help you cultivate or refine your own perspective on the quest for racial equality and nature of democracy in the United States.",

All discussion of international politics rests on conceptual foundations and assumptions that are sometimes explicit, and other times implicit. This seminar focuses on core foundations and presumptions in international relations theory. There is no right way to organize an IR theory core seminar, and the quarter system creates additional challenges. When I went to graduate school, a typical IR core seminar would include weeks on major areas of study in IR, such as war, international cooperation, international political economy, normative theories, the role of ideas in international relations, the democratic peace etc. Another approach might focus on conceptual ideas such as sovereignty, anarchy and power. This course will mix a focus on the classical paradigms in IR with a touchstone theme where different approaches are brought to life. A touchstone theme is also a way to create coherence and depth in the context of a survey course. The theme will either be considering a basic IR textbook to reflect on the mainstream ways that IR is conceptualized and taught, or we the war in Ukraine war as it reflects and reshapes past and future international politics.",

In approaching this question, we will examine three basic social motives, \"Belonging\", \"Understanding\", and \"Controlling\", and explore how these motives influence how we explain our own and others' behaviors, how we form and change our attitudes and opinions, how we are influenced by the groups to which we belong, and what compels us to help or hurt those with whom we interact. At the end of the course, we will then discuss some ways in which the answers to these questions are relevant for addressing a variety of social problems.  Course meetings will primarily consist of multimedia lectures with as many impromptu discussions as I am able to inspire.The course will involve both asynchronous activities (e.g., videos, exercises) for you to complete on your own and twice weekly synchronous meetings where we will discuss the material in more depth.  To facilitate engagement, there will also be periodic \"quizzes\" and discussions using the classroom interaction systems TopHat and Packback, so even if you don't like talking in big groups, you will still have opportunities to participate.

We will begin at the very beginning of life and learn the biological and environmental influences that help to shape people's personalities over time.

We will seek to answer questions about what motivates us, how we manage our emotions internally and in social settings, and how we interact as social beings. We will also look at ways in which personality traits may be stable over time or may be susceptible to change. Finally, we will examine the relation between personality and mental health. In what ways do different personality characteristics predispose us to or protect us from the development of psychopathology? What does it mean to have a disordered personality?In this course, we will use both a book that will serve as our primary text and additional required articles that will include research and theoretical articles. Both sources of reading will be critical for understanding this course and (especially information from the book) will not be fully covered in lectures. The research articles may be challenging if you have never read a psychology article before, and I will go over what you need to know and allow time for questions about these articles in class.

The Whorfian hypothesis -that the language we speak fundamentally influences how we think--was put forth in the 1960s, and has been a controversial topic ever since. In the last few decades, there has been new evidence from cross-linguistic studies and sophisticated laboratory studies that has sharpened the discussion.In this class we will consider the evidence both for and against the idea that language influences cognition and discuss different ways in which language interacts with cognition. We will read papers that show that different languages have different ways of talking about the word\u2014even for basic topics such as space, time, number, and causation. This brings up several questions: Do these differences in language influence people's thinking? Does this happen even when we are not using language? Does learning language influence children's cognitive development?",

As an advanced research seminar, this class will be heavily weighted toward reading and discussion of empirical and theoretical papers in psychology and related fields. Students will be required to contribute consistently to in-class discussions and to submit weekly responses to the assigned readings. Final evaluation will be based primarily on a substantial research paper submitted at the end of the quarter.",

    "ClassOverview": "The goals of this course are to introduce students to the field of psychoneuroimmunology, We will:1. Explore the conceptualization of major psychological constructs in the field, including stress, coping, social relationships, and sickness behavior2. Explore the basic principles that govern the immune system, and the issues involved in accurately measuring its function3. Identify behavioral and biological pathways that might link psychological processes with alterations in the immune system's functioning4. Understand the empirical evidence linking psychological constructs to health outcomes in the domains of infectious disease, cancer, and inflammatory diseaseThe course will meet for a 3-hour seminar each week. At each session, we'll spend the first half of our time discussing readings, and during the remainder students will present their research proposals.Grades in the course will be assigned on the basis of participation in discussions (10%), an oral research proposal (25%), performance in one of the class debates (25%), and a written research proposal (40%). Because the course is heavily oriented towards interactive discussions and student presentations, attendance is mandatory.",

We will begin with a focus on ethics in psychology. This is a critical piece of what clinical psychologists do, whether in practice, in research, or in consultation. We will review the code of ethics and will have conversations about the many gray areas and the sometimes complex interplay between our ethical and our legal obligations. Will then move into consultation, covering the various roles one can take on as a clinical psychologist and the factors to consider. Our third topic will be the history of psychology, where our goal will be to understand and contextualize the history of our field. That means taking a full look at historical figures for their accomplishments and their shortcomings and the context in which their work took place that may have shaped their thinking. It also means delving further into some of the \"hidden figures\" in the field whose accomplishments may not be as well known because of the way that some voices have been amplified over others. Finally, we will discuss issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion both as it relates to ourselves and the people we work with (clients, colleagues, mentors, students).",

    "ClassOverview": "In recent years, a burgeoning field known as Developmental Science has inspired newdisciplinary and interdisciplinary ventures, connecting fundamental principles of developmentalscience to models of developmental mechanisms in one direction, and to policy in the other.The very best work in Developmental Science draws upon strong theoretical traditions toconsider how adopting a developmental perspective enriches our understanding of developmentbroadly, including cognitive, social, language and neural development. With this broad topicalreach and with a healthy respect for crossing disciplinary boundaries, we will discuss classictheoretical issues, consider evidence from diverse methodological approaches, aim to spark newinsights, and perhaps motivate new collaborations.In this seminar, we take advantage of both timely reviews and primary source materials. Althoughwe will focus primarily on \u2018normative' human development within the first two years of life,seminar discussions will provide ample opportunity to consider how cross-species, crosslinguistic,and cross-cultural developmental research can inform these issues.This seminar is participation-intensive. Students pursuing PhD's in diverse disciplines areencouraged to join. There is one text: We will read selected chapters of Spelke's 2022 book,What Babies Know, Vol 1. Core Knowledge and Composition. There will also be a curated set ofadditional readings each week. These will center on an outstanding recent review from either theAnnual Review of Developmental Psychology or the Annual Review of Psychology, along withrelated primary source materials. Students are expected to come to each seminar meetingprepared to discuss the readings and to make connections among them.There are no prerequisites, but it would be best if students have some background in eitherCognitive Psychology, Developmental Psychology, Social Psychology or Language Acquisition.",

The course also provides a concise introduction to key concepts in Buddhism (with minimal discussion of the evolution of different Buddhist schools and sects) and how these ideas relate to topics from main-stream Psychology. As students work through the material, we will examine how the critical Buddhist observation of interdependence, especially of all living beings and their environment, leads to an ethical system based on the view that harming others is also harming oneself. Implications of these foundational concepts will be investigated in relation to class materials.",

At the same time, it is also a course about the general nature of theory construction and theory testing in the field of Psychology. Thus, the goals of the course are for students to become familiar with the wide range of formal theories that drive social psychological research, but also to become skilled at evaluating the assumptions that underlie particular theoretical accounts of human social behavior and understanding what generally characterizes good theories.  Learning how to design research that considers and tests alternative theoretical accounts for particular phenomena will be emphasized.",

We consider border issues from multiple perspectives, including but going beyond issues of surveillance and enforcement. As a first-year seminar, the course also emphasizes critical research and writing skills to prepare you for college-level research and writing. You are strongly encouraged to consult a peer tutor at the Writing Place (writingplace@northwestern.edu). We will discuss academic integrity and get tips from a librarian on how to make the most of the library's resources during your time at Northwestern.",

How does one study a moving target?In the first weeks of the course, we look back in time to understand how the ideas about religion that are familiar to us today are rooted in history. The emergence of the concept of \"religion\" as an object of comparison and study grew out of early modern European sectarian violence and colonial overseas expansion. We then turn to study some thinkers from the 19th and 20th centuries who developed theories about the best ways to study religion. These scholars developed and honed the fields of sociology, anthropology, and psychology by testing their methods on case studies about religion. To know this history is to know our present, as well as to understand the methodologies that shape the university curriculum. What do we do with this legacy? Are these methods adequate to understanding religion today?In the second half of this class, we critically evaluate these methods by putting them to work to analyze religion in the world, both past and present. We will focus on how religion moves people. People are rooted in space and place by their religious practices, while simultaneously being moved by religion. As will have become clear in the first half of the course, religion is a moving target because people themselves do not stay the same. Throughout the course, we track the tension between rootedness and mobility by examining three themes: \"conversion,\" \"borderlands,\" and \"death/afterlives.\"",

Where these words come from, how they are put together, and why they are arranged in a particular order are questions we explore in order to work out their meaning. Topics addressed will be how Christians interpret the Bible, how they make claims about God in relation to self and world, and how ideas about Christianity have changed (while remaining recognizable as a tradition) in different cultural settings.

Some of the great texts ofworld literature are written in Sanskrit and knowledge of Sanskrit (and related languages) is essential forthe study of ancient India.This course is the first of a two quarter sequence that provides instruction in the Sanskrit language forbeginners. No prior knowledge is required for 305-1. It begins a comprehensive introduction to theSanskrit language, while engaging students from the beginning in the practice of translation.Over the course of the two-quarter sequence, students will translate adapted Sanskrit stories that growin complexity until, at the end of the second quarter, they will translate the famous short story Nala andDamayant\u012b exactly as it is presented in The Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. Other readings are adapted from the shortstory collection, The Hitopade\u015ba, The Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, and The Bhagavadg\u012bt\u0101.

Students will read various forms of literature and policy documents to assess the extent to which Marxist theory is central to the interpretation of \"religion\" in Communist China. Primary sources will include Chinese constitutional articles, white papers, and editorials in English translation. Secondary sources will cover a wide range of interpretations and perspectives on the position of religious institutions and religious practices in the PRC. The first part of this course will investigate the expression of religiosity under Communism in China; the rehabilitation of Confucian values; the constitutional protection of religion and religious belief in China; the relationship between ethnicity and religious policies; the Sinicization of religion; and the administration of the five officially accepted religious traditions in the People's Republic of China (Catholicism, Protestantism, Buddhism, Daoism, and Islam). The second part of the course will focus on the recent cases related to the Muslim Uyghurs of Xinjiang and the Tibetan Buddhists of Western China. The class will explore some of the most controversial issues related to these two ethnic minorities including terrorism, religious violence, nationalism, assimilation, foreign influence, and soft power. The course format will consist of both lectures and discussions, during which students will be encouraged to exercise critical thinking and lead in-class presentations. Students will analyze various types of documents, critically evaluate content and concepts, and endeavor to synthetize the information and communicate it effectively and thoroughly.Counts towards Religion, Law and Politics (RLP) major concentration.",

    "ClassOverview": "Are our actions free or fated? What larger forces shape the choices we make? To what do we owe our successes, and what is to blame for our mistakes? In East Asian religions, such questions have been answered with reference to a variety of different concepts of fate, fortune, and karma. These concepts shape not only how people have viewed the world, but also how they have made their way through life. This class focuses on religious approaches to questions of destiny in premodern East Asia. We begin by studying Indian Buddhist ideas of karma and early Chinese notions of fate and fortune preceding Buddhism's arrival in China, then turn to the ways people in China and Japan negotiated these various concepts over the many centuries following the arrival of Buddhism. In the end, we discover important throughlines amid the diversity of religious responses to the problem of destiny in East Asian history.",

This course explores the history, literature, philosophy, visual culture, and monastic practices of Chan/Zen Buddhism in East Asia. We pay special attention to the ways Chan/Zen innovated within the Buddhist tradition to establish a uniquely East Asian school of Buddhism. Along the way we consider the changing place of meditation in Chan/Zen practice, closely read Chan/Zen sermons and koans, analyze the role of women and gender in Chan and Zen, and conclude by considering the modern reception of Zen in the West.",

The course will be structured in two parts: in the first part students will be encouraged to build expertise in the basic concepts, definitions, and general academic consensus (as well as debates) about categories including \"religion,\" \"violence,\" \"sacrifice,\" \"ritual,\" \"martyrdom,\" and also \"nationalism,\" \"politics,\" and \"terrorism\" through reading both primary sources (in English translation) and secondary sources (scholarly writings). We will then move into an analysis of case studies that focus on specific circumstances where Buddhist rhetoric, scriptural authority, and religious practices have played a role in violence including suicide, terrorist-related actions, and self-immolation predominantly in pre- and modern Asia.Some of the provocative questions that this course asks include: Why and how is religion involved in politics? Is Buddhism a pacifist religion? How does religion rationalize violence? How can some Buddhist leaders embrace terror as a political tool? Are the recent practices of self-immolation in Tibet acts of violence? Can non-violence be violent?Counts toward Religion, Law, and Politics (RLP) religious studies major concentration.",

    "ClassOverview": "Today, religion and science are often regarded as separate spheres of knowledge and practice, but was this always the case? In this class, we will explore the overlapping uses of medicine, miracles, and magic in premodern healthcare. We will ask what kinds of people were able to practice medicine (priests? physicians? nuns? magicians?), why a person's barber was also their surgeon, how the dead supported the health of the living, and why rituals like confession could treat stomach aches and other ailments.We will learn what a vial of urine could tell a medieval physician about a patient's habits, consider how an individual's astrological sign influenced their treatment plan, and discuss what an excess of garlic in a person's diet might tell us about the moral state of their spirit. By the end of this course, students will be able to identify and analyze the complex, nuanced systems that medieval people used to theorize the body and its relationship to the soul, and will be able to articulate how physical, spiritual, and even supernatural medicines were often combined to treat both.As we study the nuances of premodern medicine, we will also work to rethink the relationship between religion and science in our own world, and consider whether and where our modern healthcare practices align with the past as much as they depart from it.Counts towardReligion, Health, and Medicine (RHM)major concentration.",

Du Bois in his seminal text \"The Souls of Black Folks\" states, \"The innate love of harmony and beauty that set the ruder souls of his people a-dancing, a-singing, and a-laughing raised but confusion and doubt in the soul of the black artist; for the beauty revealed to him was the soul-beauty of a race which his larger audience despised, and he could not articulate the message of another people.\"This course examines how religion becomes the source language and practices for Black artists to express what it means to be Black in the Americas.

In developing individual research projects, we will foreground different methodological approaches:1) To move beyond journalism, we will conduct primary and secondary historical research to understand the complex historical roots of the particular case study.2) We will analyze and practice forms of ethnographic writing to help students better situate and describe the lived experience of migration and exile, both past and present.3) We will also pay attention to various forms of media, whether print culture, sound, or visual media, to interrogate but also experiment with contemporary modes of narrating and conveying human experience in the digital age.Our work in class will be collaborative, thus a key prerequisite is that you are mature and self-motivated. You do not need to have prior research experience, but you need to demonstrate a desire to dig into your topic and hone your ability to write deeply informed, rigorous, and nuanced arguments and to think about creative ways to bring that rigorous detail to visual story-telling.Students are required to petition for permission to enroll in the class (see instructions in the \"Registration Requirements\" section).*Counts towardsReligion, Law and Politics (RLP)andReligion, Sexuality and Gender (RSG)religious studies major concentrations.",

Rather, magic often draws upon the belief systems, the rituals, even the structures of authority provided by religion. Frequently it meets disapproval from others in the religious tradition, but not always. If magic in many of its forms is integrally linked to religion, however, we still have to examine how the two are connected, how a particular form of magic relates to a specific religious tradition, how it challenges what people believe, how it can both subvert and be coopted by authority, and how it serves people's perceived needs differently from other religious practices.Counts towardReligion, Health, and Medicine (RHM)religious studies major concentration.",

But the feminist revolution changed all that, as dozens of women writers were rediscovered, edited, and translated. In this seminar we will read some of the most accomplished, representing a variety of genres and linguistic traditions: Hildegard of Bingen, Christina of Markyate, Mechthild of Magdeburg, Marguerite Porete, Catherine of Siena, Julian of Norwich, and Margery Kempe. The genres in question include visionary theology, hagiography (and autohagiography), letters, liturgical song, and theological dialogue, along with a selection of critical and historical essays. Issues to be explored will include the nature of \"authorship\" and \"authority\" as applied to women, their tendency to expand or even explode the conventions of genre, the roles of male hagiographers and scribes, and sanctity vis-a-vis heresy.Requirements:regular attendance and participation; one oral presentation (10 min.) based on a short paper; term paper of 12-15 pp., with a bibliography of at least 10 items.",

    "ClassOverview": "A current discussion in the humanities concerns \"repair\" as integral to the \"postcritical turn,\" with repair referring to approaches to culture, religion, and politics that emphasize imagination, creativity, and possibility. While \"critique\" unmasks the power relations deployed in discourse, the postcritical turn explores ways in which the harm done by the will to power may be alleviated. This seminar turns to the Frankfurt School (Horkheimer and Marcuse, in particular) to begin the work of conceptualizing repair at the outer boundaries of philosophy and religious theory. Other proposals in religious-conceptual and theological categories, as well as in empirical anthropological and sociological terms, are studied in order to explore options past and present for how a transcendent notion of repair is related dialectically to immanence. Topics addressed are a metaphysic of history; epistemology of religious knowledge; Roman Catholic, Protestant and Jewish theologies of the relation between system and deity; current empirical studies of the supernatural; the question of political resistance; and importantly, the pressing issue of climate apocalypse that exacerbates the question of repair.

The course will investigate the history of feminist approaches to religious studies as well as new directions in current scholarship including black feminist and womanist theologies, goddess feminism, postcolonial and transnational feminisms, and secular and post-secular feminisms. We will consider the following questions: What does it mean to apply a gender studies lens to the study of religion? How do feminist conceptions of \"liberation\" reinforce or reject religious conceptions of \"liberation\"? How does taking religion seriously transform feminist theory? And how does taking feminist theory seriously transform research practices, subjects, archives, and methods in religious studies? In thinking through these topics, we will (re)read some feminist classics as well as focus on a selection of significant recent works important for students of feminist theory and religious studies.This course seeks to move beyond prevalent assumptions of Judeo-Christian normativity in its analysis of feminist contributions to the study of religion. It pays particular attention to feminist approaches to the study of Asian religions, but with flexibility to highlight other geographic/thematic areas of interest to graduate students enrolled in the course.",

    "ClassOverview": "\"Birthright Citizenship\"This discussion-based seminar is an introduction to the social scientific and historical study of U.S. citizenship. Debates over immigration and citizenship are long-standing in the United States. And today's politicians continue to raise concerns over who (as in what kind of people) should be granted membership. These are fundamentally questions over who belongs and who is deserving. Some on the right, including the 45th President, seek to abolish birthright citizenship, claiming it is a \"magnet for illegal immigration.\"Students will learn the history behind granting citizenship to anyone born in the United States. They explore the history of U.S. citizenship law and learn about the interests and justifications for narrower and more capacious definitions of citizenship. Other than birthright citizenship, what regimes for granting citizenship exist? What are the exceptions to birthright citizenship in the United States? How are decisions about and definitions of rights and membership related to ideas of race? Overall, this course will address how the United States has drawn boundaries of membership in racial terms and explore what this means for envisioning future possibilities.",

Often these social processes go unobserved or unacknowledged, and sociologists treat it as their job to shed analytical light on how people experience and participate in society. Through sociological analysis, we can answer questions like: How did Evanston become largely segregated by race? Why is it illegal for people to sell their kidneys? Is suicide contagious? Why would someone pay for Instagram followers?Sociology is a huge field of study, and includes an enormous variety of topics and methods. Each week, we will focus on a specific area of sociological study (Culture, Gender, Race, Family, Money, Deviance, etc.) with the goal of offering you a general overview of the types of questions sociologists ask and how they answer them. By the end of the quarter, you will be able to think sociologically about your own world, and hopefully develop a budding interest in one or more of the areas we discuss in class.",

We will cover a variety of topics in environmental sociology, including new directions in sustainable development and how actors such as corporations, the media, and social movements impact public opinion and environmental issues.

We will explore a range of research methods from surveys, interviewing, observational methods and content analysis to \"big\" data approaches. We will also think about the strengths and weaknesses of various sociological methods and what these methods can contribute to our understanding of the social world. We will also debate and discuss the role of the researcher in the research process along with thinking about ethical concerns and IRB protections for research subjects. We will also critically examine how social science research is presented to us in our everyday lives (including news reporting, political polls and social media postings).

We will also look at the lives of children themselves and how individuals experience being children, kids, teens, and so forth in a particular time and place.

We will also look at how childhood itself has been connected to various social problems and social concerns both historically and today.The final topic for the course will be how adolescents make the transition to adulthood socially, emotionally, and economically, and how this transition has changed over time - particularly over the last several decades.",

This course covers central tenets in the sociology of technology by pairing an empirical focus on a different technology each week with a theoretical paradigm. A total of eight technologies will serve as the exemplars through which the question(s) concerning technology will be explored: bicycles, cars, computers, facial recognition, genetic sequencing, soap, shipping containers and virtual reality. Each of these technologies is approached as a window into the social, political, racial, and economic determinants of technological innovation. The central goal of the course is to equip students with the tools for unpacking the technologies societies take for granted and critically engaging with new technologies that may reproduce social inequities. While much of the scholarship we will consider is broadly sociological, some of it is drawn from other fields, and part of the goal of the course is to show what is gained when we think about technology from an interdisciplinary perspective.

In this course, we will engage this work, much of which has been published in the past decade and a half. Course readings, which will survey scholarship on gender/sexuality in many regions of the world, will draw our attention to the ways in which gender/sexuality are implicated in capitalist, imperial and post-colonial projects as well as how gender and sexuality operate outside the \"West,\" both in practice and identity. Finally, we will consider the possibilities and limitations for studying gender/sexuality beyond our own societies. Critical approaches to gender and sexuality challenge conventional \"born this way\" narratives about gender and sexual identities as innate. This course will raise questions that will make us uncomfortable and, hopefully, transform our understandings of our own gendered and sexual identities and practices.",

    "ClassOverview": "\"Global Capitalism and Law\"Globalization entails greater interdependence and less national autonomy. It occurs as international flows of capital, goods, services, and people increase. Transactions, interactions and relationships that formerly occurred within national boundaries now occur across them. As part of globalization, legal forms and institutions are also spreading throughout the world. Transactions involving capital, goods, services and people are not self-sustaining; rather, they are supported and regulated by an institutional foundation that typically centers on the legal system. Because the frameworks that support these transactions exist primarily at the level of the nation-state, a governance mismatch has emerged. Globalization means that more is going on between national jurisdictions than within them, and tensions arise between competing institutional models. The substantive focus of this seminar is this intersection between globalizing markets and (predominately, but not exclusively) national legal forms and institutions. We will read work by sociologists, political scientists, economists, and lawyers addressing a range of issues related to the interaction between markets and legal systems, and with a particular focus on financial markets.",

Surveys from the Corporation for National and Community Service show that volunteering is associated with 30% higher employment odds. Companies are 80% more likely to choose a candidate with volunteering experience. However, college students are less likely to volunteer than their parents and high school students. This seminar will discuss the multiple benefits of volunteering in our local community. Through community service, students will gain real-world experience and develop skills-boosting opportunists while improving others' lives. Working with nonprofit organizations is an excellent way for first-year students to explore career paths and develop time-management skills. Furthermore, college students who volunteer in their local communities feel happier and have a sense of belonging. A minimum of 5 hours of community service is required to pass this course.GoalsStudents will be able to apply service-learning instruction to solve real-life problems.Students will be able to articulate and demonstrate teamwork and leadership.Students can discuss their experiences through written journals, digital media, and work in the local community.",

This course examines the cultures of al-Andalus and Christian Iberia, focusing on the period between the Islamic conquest of the Iberian Peninsula in 711, and the forced conversions and expulsions of 1492. It is structured around readings of different facets of the interaction between Jewish, Christian and Muslim communities. It will juxtapose the study of archetypal texts such as the Cantar de M\u00edo Cid or the Libro del Buen Amor with an examination of contemporary Iberian Arabic and Hebrew poetry, travelogues, philosophical texts or religious polemics. Students will also examine instances of material culture and architecture as an integral part of this history of cultural exchanges. Key themes include testing the dynamics of religious integration, exclusion and conversion; the making and breaking of inter- and intra-community boundaries; the impact of multilingualism, translation and knowledge transfer across communities; as well as the varying discourses of religious collective and individual allegiances. Students will test the validity of theoretical frameworks employed by scholars to understand the cultural production of this period: tolerance (\"convivencia\"), \"race\" and \"ethnicity\", religious violence and anti-Judaism, the impact of frontiers and borderlands, cultural \"hybridization\", or the \"global turn\". While the primary vehicular language of the class will be Spanish, the course will also explore the linguistic diversity of the premodern Iberian Peninsula. As such, sources will be included that demonstrate how Castilian interacted with Portuguese, Catalan, Arabic, Hebrew and hybrid languages such as Aljamiado or Ladino, both in modern Spanish and English translation.",

Our analysis will be both an individual experiment, and a collective analysis.

Working through conceptual account as well as closely reading photographic images, we reflect on this medium as conditioning our access to contemporary aesthetic experience and its ethicopolitical futurity.  A fundamental question we explore throughout:  If Aesthetics has historically been the realm of thought where universalizing claims of political and self-determined subjecthood posed the threshold of the human subject in and of their representation, how have unfreedom, subjection, and social injustice have administered visibility and recognition? What conceptual instrument contemporary thinking of photography and photographic practices provide us to de-naturalized the way these regimes have taught us to see.Readings will include, with those mentioned above: Allan Sekula, Harun Farochi, Vilem Flusser, Deborah Willis, Kaja Silverman, Eduardo Cadava, Shawn Michelle Smith and the photographic corpus will encompass historical and contemporary, Latin America and American photography with special focus on Latinx photographers.",

Two types of methods are considered in detail: observed data and data augmentation methods. The observed data methods are applied directly to the likelihood or to the posterior density. These include: Newton- Raphson, Laplace's method, Monte Carlo and Metropolis methods. The data augmentation methods rely on an augmentation of the data which simplifies the likelihood or posterior density. These include: EM, Data Augmentation, Poor Man's Data Augmentation and the Gibbs sampler. All methods are motivated and illustrated with real examples.",
