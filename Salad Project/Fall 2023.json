After introductory sessions covering fundamental concepts that facilitate musical study, we will outline the development of rock music before concluding the term with case studies from countries such as Brazil, Niger, the Philippines, and Spain. While this class does not utilize an assigned textbook, students will be expected to read articles and consider video examples in preparation for each meeting.

Although the majority of the repertoire covered in class is selected from the common-practice period of Western music (roughly 1700-1900), we will also occasionally explore how common-practice tonality influences contemporary music including jazz, pop, etc. The goal is to enrich students' understanding of tonality and harmony, and to provide tools for active listening experiences.

Before 1800, nearly all performances presented exclusively contemporary music, and works more than about fifty years old were considered hopelessly outmoded.

The course comprises theoretical sessions, practical sessions, and laboratory sessions. The theoretical sessions develop foundational concepts, theories, and approaches underpinning the characterization, analysis, and prediction of the structure, properties, and behavior of geomaterials. The practical sessions apply the gathered theory to solve a variety of earth surface engineering problems, with an outlook on the interplay between the structure, properties, and behavior of geomaterials and the engineering performance of natural and built environments. The laboratory sessions propose and guide through hands-on activities and laboratory tests of geomaterials to address basic earth surface engineering problems.",

With the complexity of collaborative technology channels continually advancing, digital marketers need to learn to navigate and benefit from the growing opportunities within modern digital ecosystems.Digital ecosystems are networks of interconnected resources such as interdependent organizations, people, activities, information, and assets that are often created and controlled by market share leaders. They combine internal (ex. employees) and external (ex. customers) stakeholders for different types of value-driven exchanges that ultimately drive forward specific business goals. Digital ecosystems use people, processes, and technology to create integrated strategies that build value and maximize marketing and business initiatives. Digital ecosystems incorporate employee experience platforms, intranets, messaging and collaboration hubs, review sites, tech forums, social media, messaging, and audio platforms into the brand experience.Students will learn the inner workings of digital ecosystems, how to develop a resonant brand within digital ecosystems, strategy rollout, and attribution of digital activation programs in this course. Ultimately students will come away from this course with a clear picture of how brands can not only survive digital ecosystems but how to thrive within them.

Students will engage in written and oral argument using major U.S. Supreme Court cases to more fully understand the difficult job appellate judges have in making sound precedent for society that resonates beyond the facts of a particular case. We cover the basic areas of First Amendment law, such as prior restraint, libel, obscenity and time-place-manner restrictions. Students will also be exposed briefly to a concise overview of non-Media Law subjects taught for the purpose of demonstrating context. We then study the ethical ramifications of Media Law precedents ascertaining the positive (what the law is) and distinguishing it from the normative (what the law should be). Discussion and assignments will emphasize the practical implications and meaning of these cases and legal concepts for journalists working in the age of social media, changing news delivery systems and overt hostility to the press.",

We will learn basic legal vocabulary terms in order to facilitate lively debate and understanding of the material. The course relies on the case method - reading actual judicial opinions to derive the legal \u2018rule' that governs various media law disputes - in order to allow students to obtain the most realistic picture of the law obtainable by non-lawyers. Students will engage in written and oral argument using major U.S. Supreme Court cases to more fully understand the difficult job appellate judges have in making sound precedent for society that resonates beyond the facts of a particular case. We cover the basic areas of First Amendment law, such as prior restraint, libel, obscenity and time-place-manner restrictions. Students will also be exposed briefly to a concise overview of non-Media Law subjects taught for the purpose of demonstrating context. We then study the ethical ramifications of Media Law precedents ascertaining the positive (what the law is) and distinguishing it from the normative (what the law should be). Discussion and assignments will emphasize the practical implications and meaning of these cases and legal concepts for journalists working in the age of social media, changing news delivery systems and overt hostility to the press.",

It's designed to provide an overview of the domain for graduate students who aim to report on, write for, edit in, or curate for magazines broadly defined (print, online, or both). The course is intended as a magazine-inflected complement to the other major course of the term -- reporting and revising in your project-based learning class during the first quarter.Our work together is primarily based on reading, viewing, and analysis of major magazine titles - legacy as well as newcomers - to explore the fundamental qualities of strong narratives. No matter what role you envision for yourself in media, our work will be relevant. Is it your ambition to create new knowledge through writing journalistic pieces for existing outlets? Or to edit, curate, produce, or otherwise serve as a team leader on investigative projects? Or to become an entrepreneur launching something brand new?This is the place to consider the heart of the matter - the power of diverse story forms for different purposes - and to deepen your understanding of them as you prepare yourself for a year-long exploration of your own talents. Every person involved in the creation of meaningful journalism, after all, should be literate in key elements of compelling journalism.The course is designed, in particular, for students who will move in the next three quarters of study to magazine presentation, digital media, magazine editing, and feature writing. For students who intend to finish up in the Narrative Capstone, here's the first step on that pathway.Each week we'll sink deeply into the editorial architecture of a particular magazine outlet. We'll regularly hear directly from writers and editors, in person and via Zoom or Skype. We'll build towards a broad view of what's currently happening in the domain, helping each student clarify where s/he would like to put her effort during the year.The overarching idea is to reveal varied approaches to immersion reporting, story framing, and sustained narrative.",

In this Ways of Knowing course, we will unpack the notion of a liberal education and its quintessential space, the university. We will critically examine the very idea of knowledge: What makes the knowledge you acquire here valuable? Which kinds of knowledge are considered to be significant and authoritative in the societies we live in, and why? How is this knowledge produced, for what purposes, and with what social effects? What are the entanglements between knowledge and power? Who has the authority to produce it, who do we count as an authoritative knower on an issue, and why? What makes this knowledge valuable to you and how does it serve the goals you came to pursue? The goal of this class is to encourage and enable you to critically reflect on the conditions of your learning and the purposes for which you are pursuing it. More specifically, you will learn about colonial knowledge production and its manifestations in the contemporary world. Thus, we will look at education in our postcolonial context, where there is nothing really post about colonialism. We will examine how dominant forms of knowledge production have been and continue to be shaped and influenced by colonialism. To do this, we will explore the history of colonial knowledge production, specifically focusing on the idea of the human as a primary way of understanding our world. Throughout the semester, we will explore topics of education, power, knowledge production, colonialism and humanity through the lens of philosophy, anthropology, history and literature, but also thinking of these various modes of knowledge production as intersecting with and informing each other. Our goal is to get you to think critically about different ways of understanding the world. We also want you to think about how we have gotten to where we are, as well as to equip you with tools for critiquing the world around you, especially your own university - your second home for the next two years.",

Instead, it explores what the future might look like when (and if) it is imagined by overlooked, marginalized individuals and communities. Students will explore the future through past histories, what the future is (and isn't), the nature of non-linear/fractured time, and how to \u2018make sense' of common/non - sense. Students will look at the Future as imagined by the Gulf city-state, examining conceptions of modernity, belonging, transience, and citizenship. They will also explore the relationship of humans to technology, and the possibilities it presents in shaping alternative identities and realities. The course uses Futures \u2018games' and role-playing as a learning method to help practice \u2018speculative futuring' by engaging students to \u2018game out' possibilities for the future. The goal of this course is to encourage students to think about the \u2018far-off future' intellectually, and to engage with futurist thinking as a practical skill that can create tangible change in their surrounding communities as well as in their own personal life.",

    "ClassOverview": "Magazine and Feature Writing students will be introduced to the editorial and multimedia flank of the magazine world (online and print), a huge and storied part of not just journalism but an influential sphere of public discourse\u2014political and cultural. Students will learn to write and edit various \"kinds\" of magazine stories. Though they originated in print magazines, these archetypical stories have seamlessly transitioned in online publications to a significant extent. (We will discuss the differences between online stories and print.) This is a writing-emphasized, editing-dependent class. But it is not exclusively about writing. You will learn important skills and will be shown an expansive venue for your story ideas, storytelling abilities and, of course, your unique writing style and writer's voice. NEW: It will also accept audio-visual storytelling. By this point in the journalism program, students are expected to have advanced writing skills so that we may focus more on the various structures and approaches to magazine writing. Students are expected to develop their story ideas (in close consultation with your instructor and classmates) and find sources required to produce interesting and well-told stories. Also, you will produce your own multi-media accompaniments to your stories. As such, you will be introduced to open-source offerings that permit students to design creative art concepts intended to accompany and augment their written pieces. An example is the work done by Medill's Knight lab.",

Building on empirical examples, course examines how reporting and discussion of gender, poverty, disasters, political unrest, underdevelopment and development by international media organizations affect how the global south and its diverse populations are imagined and represented, and also shapes international and national policy and politics. Using theories of ideology, critical political economy and post-coloniality, the course investigates questions concerning the role of international, national, NGO and subaltern media in development, including the failure of colonial relationships of power to pass away. The course offers insight into how to approach the study of media constructions, discourses and representations of, and about, the global south and its citizens",

Legal rules are almost always paired with normative concerns, and the course is necessarily comparative given NUQ's diverse student body.

    "ClassOverview": "Social movements are a ubiquitous feature of political life, both historically (especially since the onset of modernity) and in the present. They may be long, short, general, specific, civil, transgressive, violent, and non-violent. They are often protest movements seeking to bring about social change. They are usually concerned with rectifying an existing social \"wrong\"\u2014something unjust, oppressive, discriminatory, or exclusionary\u2014by directly mobilizing people through non-traditional political and judicial routes. In many cases, social movements involve \"demands\" that aim to capture public attention and pressure governmental action.This course will seek to further our understanding of social movements by posing and exploring a series of questions: Why do social movements occur, often in clusters, more frequently in some periods than in others? What are the main theories of social movements? How have social movements changed over time? How has our understanding of social movements changed over time? What are social movement organizations (SMOs) and how do they function? Why do some people, not others, become active participants in social movements? How has globalization affected social movements?  How have new technologies of information and communications influenced the scope and function of social movements? What are the strategies and tactics, both discursive and non-discursive, that social movements deploy to publicize their goals and demands? Why do some social movements succeed while others fail? Why do so many social movements decay, decline, and disappear?",

This class offers an opportunity to learn how to analyze and critique how media technologies, infrastructures, and uses can impact cultures, meanings, and identities as well as global politics. We will look at the role that music, a hashtag, or even feelings can play in bringing people together as a group. The readings are a combination of theoretical texts and ethnographic case studies. Looking at publics from different cultures, we will unpack how group identities (like national, cross-cultural, and subcultural) can be formed or disrupted, and the role of media throughout these processes. We will touch on ethnographic methods as a way to research publics or groups, and work on refining critical thinking, verbal, and writing skills.",

    "ClassOverview": "Since the onset of modernity, especially since the 18th century, a family of concepts such as public, publicity, public opinion, public interest, and public affairs have become indispensable for understanding how society, politics, and communication practices are distinctively and complexly intertwined.  The term \"public\" signifies relatively unrestricted communication across civil society regarding governance and other matters affecting the general welfare. Theoretical articulation of the \"public sphere\" has directed critical understanding of key institutions in modern societies, including the liberal-democratic state, capitalist social relations, the media and culture industries, and social movement protests. Similarly, another set of concepts such as audience, spectator and spectatorship, crowds, parades and marches, rallies, carnivals, fairs, and festivals, both calendric and contingent, have becomes equally indispensable for understanding the dynamics of the capitalist political economy which is dependent on ever escalating consumption cycles.  This seminar will focus on the crossing of these two networks of concepts, one foregrounding the political subjectivity of the citizen and the other targeting the market subjectivity of the consumer, to identify and analyze a full range of deep problems afflicting the seemingly \"ungovernable\" liberal-capitalist democratic societies today.  Readings include John Dewey, Walter Lippmann, J\u00fcrgen Habermas, Oskar Negt and Alexander Kluge, Nestor Garca Canclini, Miriam Hansen, Michael Warner, Lauren Berlant, John Peters, and others.",

    "ClassOverview": "Jump Rhythm\u00ae focuses on using the syncopated rhythms of jazz, funk, and/or rap music to generate emotion-rich, time-precise, rhythmic expression in both body and voice. In its classes we accompany all exercises, improvisations, and partnered movement-scenes with jazz-based scat-singing. We also use scat-singing's percussive quality to sing the words of songs that accompany some exercises.  This prominent use of the voice turns this approach to performing arts training into an energy-charged, acting-singing class as much as a movement class. We also sing the lyrics to songs - but, again, singing them in this jazz-inflected way.\t\tNote the phrase \"energy-charged.\" Jump Rhythm focuses on articulating the physical and emotional ENERGY we feel roiling about on the inside of our bodies, rather than on articulating the SPACE we see on the outside of the body, whether our own or another person's.\t That is, this class is not like what you may have experienced in a typical, ballet-based dance class.  In the latter much of the learning depends on using a mirror to help you rearrange the positions of your body parts so that they can conform to a pre-established \"look.\"  There is also a continuous emphasis placed on the legs - learning how to place them in non-natural positions so we can turn them into marvelous engines of gymnastic virtuosity. Differently, Jump Rhythm focuses on expressing energy through our 2 eyes, 2 hands, and voice. We call these our 5 primary physical and emotional articulators.  Actors and singers know these parts, especially the voice, as the means they use to deliver the words of a play or a song  Given that Jump Rhythm is a both music-driven and acting-driven class, we team them up these small but might articulators to express clear rhythmic accents.  That is, we use eyes-hands-voice as drumbeaters to strike sharp or explosive accents against the drumheads of the space with, as best we can, pinpoint accurate timing.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\tThese drumheads include the imaginary spaces that surround the body; the actual surfaces of the body we tap hands against and use like beatbox; and that very real drumhead loved by all tap and step dancers:  the floor.  In addition to the fact that we focus on expressing energy not shape, and in addition to the fact that we rhythmically vocalize all the movement we do, Jump Rhythm is also different from a typical ballet-based dance classes in one more way: it is built upon the foundation of a holistic approach to mind-body health called Standing Down Straight\u00ae.  Standing Down Straight\u00ae. In Jump Rhythm, we do not explore movement or sing music using either an uplifted posture (\"standing up straight\") or core strength (over-contracted abdominal muscles).  Differently, we do all voice-and-body work by standing down straight (SDS).  \t\t\tSDS is a \"green,\" less-is-more pedagogy.  With it, we explore learning how to use less muscular tension when driving force through the body and voice.\tIn this way we honor the animal in us - to the extent that we wish to emulate how our animal cousins know how to get what they want with ease, economy, fluency, and pinpoint power.  Inspired by this model, we explore how to work from a base of anatomically fact-based, gravity-directed, skeletal relaxation.  \t\tThis inspiration in mind, we build into every activity of this class when not just to \"do,\" to \"perform,\" but also when to slow down both the mind and the body.  Slowing them down so that we can teach the bones of our body not to lift and hypertense - which, for instance, standing up straight and core strength promote - but rather to \"sit\" and \"hang\" in response to gravity's downward pull.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn sum:  SDS allows us to, in a sense, not-work as well as work. We practice this apparently paradoxical approach to moving and vocalizing in all of our exercises beginning with the one called Constructive Rest.  In it, we use visualizations to help the body's bones go where the pull of gravity is directing them to go",

    "ClassOverview": "We tend to think of creative works in aesthetic or artistic terms: the way they tell us stories, present us with larger-than-life performers, fill our daily lives with music, or inform us about the world. However, the films, television shows, videogames, and popular recordings that we enjoy are produced, distributed, and marketed using the techniques and strategies of modern industry: that is, show business is just as much about the business as it is the show. This combination of art and industry has long sparked debate about the status of the cultural or creative industries, and the ways in which they intermingle art and commerce. What is distinctive about the creative industries as industries? What makes an \"authentic\" expression within this context? Where does the creativity lie in the complex and collaborative productions of the creative industries? What role do advertising and market research play in shaping creative products? To what degree can audiences take an active role in their experience of creative works? How have technological or regulatory developments influenced the way in which creative products are produced, distributed and consumed? What is the culture of work in the creative industries, and how can it be made to be more diverse and inclusive? How can media texts be made so that they cross cultural or national boundaries?This course will address these and other questions through an engagement with scholarship on a range of media industries including film, radio, television, popular music, advertising, animation, and digital gaming. The course is designed to provide a historical and theoretical introduction to media industries and to allow students to apply that knowledge to a range of industrial contexts. Our investigation will highlight several business-oriented career paths that RTVF majors might follow after graduation and will be enriched by conversations with Northwestern alums currently working in those areas.",

The four core projects will offer experience with experimental, documentary, and narrative editing strategies and techniques, including continuity, associative and expressionistic styles and systems. They are designed to develop conceptual and technical skills, as well as strategies necessary to provide a foundation for further exploration. You will be graded on your ability to satisfactorily complete these projects in the time frame allotted, as well as through attendance, discussion participation, and pop-quizzes.",

Discussion of the films is a key part of exploring the craft.Note: this is not a course designed to teach you how to use a specific camera. Use of almost any camera is acceptable, including any camera you personally own.  Cameras from the cage can be checked out based on your particular qualifications / class or workshop completion.We will also build one or two DIY lights at the end of the quarter for each student to keep.",

    "ClassOverview": "As techniques for sonic expression have grown more sophisticated - from installation art to narrative podcasts and video games - the questions that we bring to bear on sound and its place in our lives and histories have also begun to evolve. This course aims to give sound professionals a grounding in that conversation by immersing them in Sound Studies, a new and inspiring field that occupies an intersection between the arts, social sciences and humanities.Sound Studies helps us to understand how music works through the popular media, interprets and unpacks great soundtracks and albums, uncovers the history of the sound technologies that we use, asks how hearing changes over time and across cultures, looks at the politics behind forms of vocal expression and mixing particularly around issues of race, gender and identity, and calls attention to sonic dimensions of environments. In recent years, Sound Studies has also been taking the form of sound and provides raw ideas for podcasts, films and other sound works. Indeed, it was scholar Murray Schafer who coined the term \"soundscape,\" a concept that is now not only used by a whole field of artists, but also by acousticians, game developers and urban planners.Each week we begin by considering significant works of sonic expression, using them as a framework to understand key questions in Sound Studies today. Though much of our emphasis will be on sound in popular forms of media, we will also consider various forms of sound technology, sound art, and sound performance. Students will be introduced to a range of sound-based industries and learn how they work together. Key works of sound art and design will demonstrate the aesthetics of sound, for example: the expressive ways in which sounds are combined with images in media culture; and how mediated sounds facilitate new encounters with the lived environment. Students will gain an understanding of how sound mediates identity and provides a medium for cultural expression.",

We will study plays such as The Laramie Project and The Yellow Boat; theatre projects led by artists such as Ping Chong (Undesirable Elements Project) and Rhodessa Jones (Medea Project: Theater for Incarcerated Women); and productions by local community-based ensembles such as Albany Park Theater Project.

While applying these different analytic lenses, we will attend to change processes occurring at four different levels of analysis identified by scholars of organizational change: individual, group, organization, and institution.  We will also examine the ways in which different lenses shed light on particular levers or resources for organizational change.

Skilled educators continually take experiences from the field in the form of observations, curiosities, and challenges to inform structured inquiry\u2014with the purpose of improving conceptual and pedagogical understandings for themselves and their students. MSED 407-1 & 407-2 are grounded in a model of action research. In our view, action research is not distinct from the work of teaching and educating, rather when done well it drives the work of teaching and learning. Data we use in action research is precisely that which we encounter in our educational settings on a daily basis\u2014we are responsible for mining and learning from them. As a result of these courses you will not only have designed and conducted action research\u2014 your Master's Project \u2014but more importantly, you will have a set of stances and tools to embark on a career as an educator scholar who continues to notice various aspects of teaching and learning, ask important questions, and engage in meaningful, guided examinations of practice to evolve learning.The goal of MSED 407-1 and 407-2 is to help you become informed educators who are able to turn curiosities and challenges from your settings into potential areas of structured reflection and research. The basis of the course is the model of action research \u2014 of studying our own settings around questions we are passionate about, for the purpose of improving our students and colleagues learning as well as our own practice. Action research is not distinct from the work of teaching, rather the data we use in action research is precisely that which we encounter in our educational settings daily. As a result of these courses you will not only have conducted action research\u2014 your Master's Project \u2014more importantly, you will have the tools to embark on a career as an educator scholar who continues to ask important questions and embark on meaningful, systematic examinations of teaching and learning in your selected setting.During MSED 407-1, you chose a question that was of personal importance to you. You reviewed relevant literature related to this question, you identified different types of classroom data to investigate this question. During MSED 407, we will focus on techniques for analyzing the data that you have collected, revisit the literature surrounding our project, and consider how the work will influence your teaching and learning moving forward. In addition to meeting as a whole class, a central component of the 407-1 and 407-2 course sequence is working in coaching groups.",

How does the source and type of knowledge interact with socio-political-cultural constructs and systems of power and, in turn, how can \"knowledge\" be used to produce and/or perpetuate power and privilege or to empower those who are marginalized? Finally, how does what we do in SESP and at Northwestern as both consumers and producers of knowledge fit within the landscape of these questions?In this course students will explore these and other questions to gain insight into the social production, distribution, consumption, interpretation, and operationalization of \"knowledge.\" Using primarily seminar-style discussion, the first portion of the course focuses on building and analyzing theoretical frameworks and applied texts in order to generate a working understanding of \"knowledge\" in its myriad forms.  Among our goals for the first portion of the course is to tie theoretical,  academic, and \"folk\" knowledges to everyday experiences and the world around us writ large.  The second portion of the class will involve a series of applied of cases studies, including welcoming members of the SESP faculty community to present on their research, which we will work to bring into conversation with our generated frameworks regarding the sources, types, and implications of knowledge.",

The course applies a social justice lens to investigate multiple domains of development, including biological, cognitive, emotional, and social. We will look at interactions between these domains and continually highlight influences of contextual factors, such as family, schools, society, and culture. We will also review how to read, understand, and evaluate academic articles as well as apply findings and theory to public policy. This course aims to foster respectful critique and cultural humility as well as application of developmental science to inform policy, practice, and support of our community.",

We'll explore how we come into the work as researchers - the frameworks, positionality, beliefs and biases that inform how we see the world. The course objectives include understanding the ways in which our own lenses shape what we see (or don't see) in our view of the world, how that affects our interpretations, and how, ultimately, we engage in meaningful field-based research.",

    "ClassOverview": "Social policy is integral to the fabric of society. It helps to determine who has access to resources and services, regulates how those are obtained, and is constantly negotiated by changing ideas about public need and the common good. A primary goal of this course is to explore social policy in the United States as a political, economic, and ideological process that is embedded in the racialized, classed, and gendered context of American society. In this class, we will learn about factors that shape policymaking, examine ways that policy impacts society through institutional and interpersonal pathways, and practice skills to analyze policy from development to implementation.The first part of the course will focus on policy framing and development as key elements of policymaking. We will examine how social issues become policy problems, how and why policy agendas are set, whose voice is represented, and how research is engaged in the policymaking process. We will form policy workgroups to examine specific policy problems and learn about the ways that policy seeks to address social issues like poverty, educational access, and violence. Individually, students will have the opportunity to focus in on a specific social issue that is meaningful to them and explore how policy is used to address it. The second part of the course will focus on policy implementation, with an emphasis on the ways that policy impacts people differently depending on their identity, social status, and positionality in society. We will develop policy analysis skills, use analytical tools to examine impact, and learn how to read, write, and interrogate policy briefs as public-facing documents.",

In its simplest form, parallel events or social structures in two societies are examined. In its more complex variants, a range of similarities and differences across many societies may be studied.

This course is a hybrid of the research seminar and the writing workshop, and we will confront the challenges of both researching and writing in a collaborative manner. To that end, some of our sessions will be devoted to reading and responding to one another's work. While it can be difficult and intimidating to publicly present your work, and to publicly critique or question another's work, we will undertake both in the spirit of support and assistance in the hopes of creating a community of researchers, writers, and scholars. Becoming a careful reader, responder, and recipient of constructive criticism are invaluable skills that fundamentally inform the process by which virtually all scholarly work is produced.",

In addition, different human groups or ethnicities vary markedly in the burden of these conditions, with factors like poverty, inequality and discrimination consistently predicting who is most affected. What might account for these common findings?  In this course we explore two related ideas to gain insights into these issues. The first is that many modern ailments may be viewed as an imbalance between modern life ways and those which shaped our biology during much of human evolution. The second is that differences in factors like inequality and discrimination, which trace to political, economic, and historical factors, help explain why some groups tend to be more affected by these conditions than others. We will begin by reviewing foundational concepts in evolutionary biology, molecular biology, anthropology and human evolution, revealing why our bodies by necessity come equipped with biology that is responsive and sensitive to the environments that we inhabit. We will then use these principles to explore domestic and global case studies that illustrate the power of evolutionary principles to shed light on why we get sick, including the role of social, economic and political factors as drivers of major disparities in disease burden.",

Over the course of the quarter, we will take what interests you about archaeology and build a scaffold for how you think about these interests and how you might examine them in depth in the future. The main goal is to produce a high quality NSF proposal by the end of the course (NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program proposal for undergraduates; NSF Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant for graduate students). To that end, we will spend time reviewing successful proposals to decipher how scholars link theory, data, methods, and analysis in their research projects. We will work our way through the main methods in every archaeologists' tool kit: regional survey, excavation, and materials analysis. Upon completion of the course, students should feel comfortable writing grant proposals and be ready to design their own independent archaeological research project.",

This can include tools, clothing, utilitarian objects, architecture, jewelry, food-associated items, and much more. In this class, we will examine all of these object types, alongside literatures from museum studies, archaeology, historical preservation, and many other fields. We will discuss how these various fields analyze, present, and preserve material items. How can material objects teach us about human social worlds? What is the barrier between a natural object and a constructed one? How and why do museums curate objects for public engagement? Students will gain skills in writing about objects and curating them for museum exhibits. Some consider the use of tools or other materials to be a defining feature of human experience; certainly, humans have reshaped and modified landscapes, chemicals, and raw materials more extensively than any other species. Relationships to the material world vary cross-culturally and even between individuals. We will discuss theoretical literatures relating to material objects including new materialisms, commodity fetishism, gift-giving, phenomenology, Indigenous ontologies, object agency, and thing theory. Bringing in perspectives from various discourses, we will explore the materials that surround and are made meaningful through their mobilization in human social worlds.",

We will discuss racialization - the process by which people are assigned to categories of race and the associated stereotypes and traits tied to those categories. Because race is a social construct, anthropology is well-situated to examine how racial categories are created and made impactful through historical and social practice. Throughout the course, will examine racial categories, where they come from, how they vary across societies, and what they are used to signify or mean. With readings from the four main subfields of anthropology, students will learn about ideas and conceptualizations of race through biological, cultural, linguistic, and archaeological approaches. The course will begin by complicating and contradicting the idea that racial categories are in any way natural, scientific, or innate. We will examine the history of these categories and the process of creating and maintaining racial categories. While the course does examine racial categories across globally situated projects, we will focus especially on the United States context. The course will conclude with some models and discussions of anti-racist approaches within anthropology.",

These regimes gained even more important under the rule of authoritarian leaders in power across the globe from the US to India. What often unites Modi's India and Trump's United States is Islamophobia\u2014albeit in different guises\u2014as racialization of Islam and Muslims continues to punctuate our current era. What are the stakes of traveling while Muslim in that post 9/11 era of racing Islam? How do we come to understand such mobility? What assumptions underpin the attendant construction of Islam in such understandings, as various state and non-state actors enlist themselves to manage the movements of Muslims, specifically and exceptionally? In probing these questions, amongst others, in this seminar we aim to examine the interlocked relationship between Islam, mobility and security. We have three aims in front us: (1) becoming well-versed in studies of Islam and Islamophobia in the US and across the globe, (2) gaining a better understanding of Islam as a center tenet in a deeply uneven and racialized regime of \u2018global' mobility, and lastly, (3) critically analyzing global and local designs of security that underpin and manage those differential regimes of mobility.",

We will also inquire into how cultural anthropology articulates with the other sub-fields of the discipline as it changes in the broader social fields of academe and American political economy. Examining these core dimensions of the sub-field will provide a strong understanding of how cultural anthropologists conceptualize their subjects/objects of study in relationship to the shifting terrains in academia and national and global political economic processes. Throughout, we will address the larger stakes\u2014both ethical and political\u2014of taking particular ethnographic and theoretical approaches. We will both cultivate a critical approach to the readings, and try to understand them on their own terms in the circumstances of their production.

To develop reading and writing skills we will be using Modern Standard Written Arabic called Fu\u1e63\u1e25\u0101.  To develop speaking and listening skills we will be using an educated spoken version of the \u0101mmiyya of the Levantine dialect.  The integrated approach is an effective, logical, and economical method of instruction that successfully teaches the complexities of the Arabic sociolinguistic and diglossic situation and prepares students fully for the realities of the Arabic world.Arabic 111-1, taught in the Fall Quarter, is the first quarter of first-year Arabic.

    "ClassOverview": "This course addresses various problems in painting and introduces students to modes of visual thinking. Work will be done in a two-dimensional format using paint on a gesso-prepared ground on a canvas support. The focus is on acquiring the basic material and technical skills necessary to articulate visual ideas in paint, including how to organize compositions using color and value relationships, form and shape, placement and paint application. Although most exercises deal with problems in painting, considerable work in drawing may be required to support studies in the use of color and paint. Assignments may introduce students to a variety of subject matter, such as still life, landscape and the figure in representational and abstract form. Instruction is individualized and students and faculty participate in one-on-one discussions of works in progress. Students also participate in class discussions and critiques to develop the criteria for making their own judgments about works of visual art. Evaluation is based on the degree of growth, attendance, participation and the degree of mastery of painting materials and techniques.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course focuses on the invisible universe at radio wavelengths for non-science and science majors. Radio night sky and the solar system planets look very different than the visible night sky and planets. Studying the invisible universe provides an awe in the diversity of phenomena that our universe offers.  The realm of the invisible includes the components of the fascinating history of radio astronomy, and numerous discoveries over the last 90 years (e.g., pulsars, quasars, the Big Bang background radiation, organic molecules) and fundamental differences between radio and optical telescopes.Before 1931, the study of the universe was limited to optical observations of the night sky. Karl Jansky changed everything by building a radio telescope that could observe the sky day or night. We are all familiar with radio frequencies by listening to FM radio stations and using GPS satellites for navigation. Radio astronomy is the study of natural radio emission from celestial objects at frequencies outside FM and GPS frequencies. The human eye can see optical light but is blind to radio signals, including those that provide important clues about the history of our universe. The radio band is very broad, spanning 100,000 Hz between 10^7 to 10^12 Hz, whereas our eyes are only sensitive between red and blue, a factor of two. This course discusses new tools to unveil the `hidden' sky over a wide range of frequencies in ways that can not be viewed or understood in the optical frequencies.",

    "ClassOverview": "The word biology describes both the characteristics and processes of life and living organisms, as well as the discipline that studies these. Like all the natural sciences, the study of biology is a data-driven endeavor, concerned with describing, predicting and understanding natural phenomena based on evidence from observation and experimentation. But like all human activities, it does not exist in objective isolation, but rather within a societal context. And biological phenomena, such as infection and disease, interact with non-biological elements of human society. This course aims to contextualize the study of biology towards a better understanding of how social and cultural histories and dynamics have had a profound effect on both biological research as well as biological phenomena, and how social, political and economic parameters influence the impact of scientific breakthroughs and the outcomes of biological events such as epidemics. The topics we will cover, among others: the cultural, political and societal barriers to reaping the benefits of biological research; the damaging legacies of racism, sexism and colonialism on the biological research enterprise; the role of communications in the field of biology; and select biological topics in evolution, genetics and disease. Students will learn from press articles, academic literature and a non-fiction book (The Fever, by Sonia Shah).",

    "ClassOverview": "One of the major challenges of our changing world is the loss of biological diversity. An overwhelming majority of people agree that we should work to save biodiversity, but their views are largely based on vague, positive feelings about nature rather than concrete justifications. This course investigates those concrete justifications. The first half of the course sketches out the argument for preserving biodiversity (i.e., \"thinking globally\"). The second half of the course focuses on the practice of ecological restoration in forest preserves a few miles from campus (i.e., \"acting locally\") not merely as a way to preserve biodiversity, but as a path to redefining a sustainable relationship between nature and culture. The readings for the course range from classics of environmental writing to recent research papers in the primary scientific literature. Biodiversity also needs to be experienced directly, so we will take a field trip to a local forest preserve where we will roll up our sleeves and help restore a native habitat and see how much biodiversity means to the people with whom we live and work.",

    "ClassOverview": "Genetic and molecular biology technologies have exploded in recent years rendering medical breakthroughs and novel treatments for disease. In this course, we will delve into the basics of gene structure and function, mechanisms of gene expression control and current molecular techniques that have revolutionized biological research. Through analysis of classic and current primary publications, we will explore topics such as how genes are manipulated, how gene expression is regulated, how molecular/genetic analysis of model organisms are used, how human disease genes are discovered, and how every gene in a genome can be analyzed simultaneously. At the end of the course, students will have a deeper appreciation for cellular mechanisms of gene expression and cell regulation.",

This is followed by topics in self-assembly strategies to create materials using supramolecular chemistry to design interactions among their components. This section includes supramolecular polymerization, molecular design of liquid crystals, superlattices through molecular self-sorting, metal organic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks, colloidal crystals, gels, and layer-by-layer assemblies. The third section of the course covers design of functional nanostructures through self-assembly of amphiphiles, sol-gel chemistry, organic monolayers, quantum dot and metal nanoparticle assemblies, and carbon nanostructure systems such as graphene and nanotubes.",

This requires sufficient knowledge to use a variety of experimental techniques and to interpret their results.

    "ClassOverview": "This course introduces first year graduate students and undergraduates in chemistry to supramolecular design of materials and nanostructures. The course focuses on the synthetic methods and basic physical principles needed to create functional materials and nanomaterials for useful applications. After a general introduction, the first area covered is the synthesis of molecularly precise polymers using techniques such as living anionic and free radical reactions, atom transfer, metathesis, and recombinant synthesis of artificial proteins. This is followed by topics in self-assembly strategies to create materials using supramolecular chemistry to design interactions among their components. This section includes supramolecular polymerization, molecular design of liquid crystals, superlattices through molecular self-sorting, metal organic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks, colloidal crystals, gels, and layer-by-layer assemblies. The third section of the course covers design of functional nanostructures through self-assembly of amphiphiles, sol-gel chemistry, organic monolayers, quantum dot and metal nanoparticle assemblies, and carbon nanostructure systems such as graphene and nanotubes.",

The emphasis throughout will be on connecting behavior at macroscopic length scales, where most observations take place, and microscopic length scales, where material properties originate. Students should come away with a visceral understanding of: entropy, free energies, the relationships between statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, and phase transitions. The topics are intrinsically technical and rely on some mathematical tools that may be unfamiliar, but effort will be made to keep things as simple as possible (and no simpler). To aid with the intuitive understanding, we will make use of computational techniques for simulating and visualizing these concepts, which will require that students have (or develop) some familiarity with basic computer programming.",

Since their rediscovery in the early modern period, directors, translators, and adapters have repeatedly turned to the poetry of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides to reflect on political, ethical, social, and theological issues of their time. Most recently, the plays have proved fertile ground for directors eager to imagine alternative ways of thinking about race, gender, and class. We will read a selection of Athenian tragedies, with special emphasis on their form, ancient performance context, and themes, as well as select examples of contemporary adaptations for diverse audiences. All readings will be in translation, and students will be encouraged to work in groups to perform and develop creative responses to individual scenes.",

Exercises include but are not restricted to 1) locating events or objects from line-of-sight signal travel times, 2) de-blurring an image, 3) characterizing the subsurface from surface measurements of wave dispersion, 4) locating engineering structures from anomalous gravity data, and 5) tomography: non-destructive characterization of internal structure of materials, human bodies, or the Earth.  We will emphasize linear, discrete, ill-posed inverse problems, but will also review time series analysis, including Fourier Transforms and matched filtering, and touch on the principles of solving non-linear inverse problems via directed and random searches in model space.",

We'll then look at money and inflation. We'll finish with short-run macroeconomics, with a focus on the role of monetary and fiscal policy in stabilizing the business cycle. En route, time permitting, we will consider such contemporary issues as the role of economic policy in addressing environmental concerns and the recent financial crises.",

First, profit-seeking firms may try to reduce competition through entry deterrence, predation, horizontal mergers, vertical integration, or collusion. We will use economic theory and landmark legal cases to study the purpose and development of antitrust law, which is meant to reduce the adverse effects of anti-competitive business practices. Next, large fixed costs of building and maintaining a physical network may generate natural monopolies in markets for electric power, natural gas, and water. We will explore the challenges regulators face when they attempt to apply market controls such as price caps so an essential service remains affordable. We will also ponder the proper role of government in today's digital economy, which features a number of platforms featuring network effects that result in a small number of operating systems, streaming services or social networks. Finally, society might be willing to trade short-term welfare loss for long-term gains by granting temporary monopolies (e.g., patents or copyrights) to provide an incentive to innovate. We will analyze the ideal scope of artificial monopoly rights and the natural tension between intellectual property and antitrust law.

    "ClassOverview": "This is an introduction to issues in urban and regional economics. We will study the problems of cities, urban areas, and regions by examining the effects of geographic location on the decisions of individuals and firms. The importance of location in everyday choices is readily seen in your decision to live on or off campus (or in a new professor's decision to live in Evanston or downtown Chicago). Yet, traditional economic models do not account for spatial factors. As urban economists, we will use the tools of economic theory and empirical data to explore several interesting questions along the dimensions of why we live in cities and how do regions develop. These questions include, but are not limited to: Why do cities and regions exist? How do firms decide where to locate? Why do people live in cities? What determines the growth and size of a city and region? What is the role of cities in regional development? We will then analyze the economic problems that arise because we live in urban areas. We will focus on specific urban issues such as firm location, housing, education, transportation costs, immigration, and local government policies. Time permitting, we will briefly explore issues related to crime, poverty, and housing bubbles. We will cover a few empirical papers in class that you are expected to read in advance. Typically, this will involve reading the abstract, introduction, and conclusion of the papers to get a general overview of the contribution, research question and methodological approach.  We will analyze data using Stata or R and may also use ArcGIS, a digital mapping program.",

A central goal of the class is to develop tools for approaching literary texts as creative expressions as well as challenging reflections on society, power, knowledge, and difference.  The millennium-long sweep of English 210 will help us approach literature not as escapism but as challenging social thought articulated by means of new representational forms.  We will pay special attention to the role of transoceanic travel, exploitation, and mercantile capitalist trade in the development of English literary forms.",

    "ClassOverview": "Introducing some of the major texts, concepts, terms, and debates in the study of texts about colonialism and its aftermath, this course explores the interface of postcolonialism and other liberatory initiatives (e.g., feminism, climate activism, animal studies etc.). How can we reconceive English studies to be more inclusive of non-western cultures and their depiction of problems that face the planet as a whole? How do we compare postcolonial texts with Western canons without reinforcing the current hierarchies that privilege Western culture as the standard against which the other cultures are judged? Indeed, in what ways are Western and East Asian literatures postcolonial? What are the differences, if any, among such terms as \"anti-colonialism\", \"postcolonialism\", and \"decolonial\" studies in relation to climate activism? As we read and write about these questions, we will examine how at the root of perennial postcolonial debates (e.g., the language debate) is the question of holistic liberation of the planet. Paying attention to the formal properties of postcolonial texts, our discussions will include the structural and thematic agency the writers give to other-than-human elements of the cosmos as a gesture of absolute inclusiveness, while depicting postcolonial societies' struggle against colonial domination and the over-exploitation of the environment at the hands of global capitalism. We will read theorists and activists such as Edward Said, Ngugi wa Thiong'o, Fatema Mernissi, Homi Bhabha, Gayatri Spivak, Cajetan Iheka, Frantz Fanon, and Wangari Maathai.",

The course is designed to help you think strategically about communication, make effective communication decisions, and produce writing and presentations that are well-organized, clear, and compelling. In addition, course assignments provide an opportunity to enhance your critical reading and thinking; your ability to communicate effectively about data; your understanding of visual communication; and your understanding of interpersonal communication. There will be no final exam. However, students must be present on the final day of class for team-based presentations.",

    "ClassOverview": "Practical Rhetoric is a discussion-based course that explores the practical skills and pedagogical theories behind effective peer-to-peer tutoring in writing centers. The course is practical in that it is designed to prepare incoming tutors for their work at the Writing Place. This course also focuses heavily on both classic and current theories of the teaching of writing and of writing center-specific pedagogies. We will introduce you to classic works of writing center theory while also asking you to engage in more contemporary debates and studies in the field. Through a combination of reading about writing center pedagogies and practicing engaging with those methods in your work at the Writing Place, Practical Rhetoric seeks to prepare you to effectively coach writers at all stages of the writing process. In the spirit of the collaborative writing process that is at the heart of the Writing Place's mission, as writers this quarter, this course will ask you to regularly bring your own writing to class to workshop in a series of mock consultations and writing exercises with your classmates. You will reflect on your own positionality as a writer-- and consider what that positionality brings to your work at the Writing Place-- in a short writing assignment the first week of the quarter. You will continue to reflect on your learning in Practical Rhetoric and on your experiences working at the Writing Place in a series of weekly tutor journals. We will ask you to contribute to the work of writing center studies through your own research proposal, ideally on a topic or initiative that you can continue developing and perhaps even put into action in later quarters to improve and grow our services at the Writing Place. And at the end of the quarter, you'll bring everything you've learned together to articulate your personal tutoring philosophy.",

    "ClassOverview": "This selective-enrollment, yearlong \"Sequence\" is designed to make students increasingly informed readers and self-sustaining apprentices of poetry.  The Fall portion of the course begins with summer reading and intensive study in which poets learn to identify operative modes in poetry\u2014including description, rhetoric, story and song\u2014and begin connecting contemporary participants with root systems in the tradition. We support our studies with reading exercises and \"imitation\" assignments, in which students convert close reading into fodder for original writing. Students will write at least four papers and will write, workshop and revise four poems during the Fall term. They also will lead presentations on one chosen poet and one classmate during workshop. In the Winter term, students will continue to read and complete close reading assignments and will stretch their skills as they complete a week of \"Daily Poems,\" thereby drawing on original energy and stamina to bring their work to the next level of accomplishment. Finally, in the Spring term, students will focus entirely on their own work, drafting, revising, workshopping and completing one long poem of at least 120 lines that combines autobiographical material with writing from research. Throughout the year, our close reading assignments hone skills in sensitive and critical thinking; our imitation poems challenge existing habits as they introduce new strategies; our Daily Poems exercise agility and confidence; and our workshops cultivate the openness and humility necessary to serious writing and lifelong learning. Through this intensive and nurturing Sequence, students become careful readers of each others' work and complete a polished portfolio of original writing.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course will allow you to explore how fiction works. We'll be looking at, discussing, writing about, commenting on, and researching the elements of fiction, but mostly what we'll be doing is writing buckets (you will be turning in a completed piece every other week during the Fall quarter), so we'll be reading mostly to steal: we'll figure out what works and we'll use it for our own material. We'll be engaged in the reading of a concise, funny book on the craft of fiction, and we'll also be reading a wide and varied array of short stories. Again, though, this work is geared to do one simple thing: to find out what means and modes of expression you best respond to, and to figure out ways to approach this question: Given all the other potentially more awesome forms of entertainment out there, what is the role of sitting around scribbling things and reading other people's scribblings? Why do it? Just so you know, what we're doing in class closely replicates what all successful fiction writers do on a daily basis: reading the work of their peers and those of established and emerging authors with care, attention, and greed, and writing copious amounts to see what sticks. The more you do both of these activities, the better and more confident you'll get.",

We know how point of view works, for example, or how revision can dramatically alter our sense of a short story or an essay--I mean, we know, sort of, and to a point, and beyond that point we all do our best. The purpose of this course is two-fold: to bolster our understanding of the building elements of prose, and to push those elements further by focusing on affect, on figuring out the various ways in which a kind of intentionality in navigating tone--when we draft and revise--can allow our creative work to flourish. While we'll focus on \"comic\" and \"horrific\" approaches, the understanding is that most work is never fully working in just one mode, and we'll figure out the advantages of each, and of modulating one into the other.We'll work through a considerable deal of material together, and we'll help each other find ways to explore the possibilities of that material. But I'll also ask each of you to bring in a short published piece that you love that we'll all read; it should be a piece---a short story or a poem or an essay---that you feel best exploits a particular affect (something \"funny\" or \"scary\" or \"sad\"), and we'll all read novels and story collections where this intent is front and center, including Mona Awad's Bunny and Gretchen Felker-Martin's Manhunt.",

Surveying both foundational and cutting-edge methods and theories in literary studies, this course asks students to grapple with the key questions and debates at play in the field(s) and discipline. The course begins with an inquiry into the history of the institution, the field(s) of literary studies, broadly conceived, and the questions of center and periphery that remain central to our work. We will then shift to an investigation of contemporary keywords guiding literary studies in the present.Foregrounding the disorienting effects of the literary, the course begins by examining the history of the discipline and its institutions, including shifting definitions of our objects of study; the histories of exclusion and inclusion that accompany these shifts; and, issues of canonicity, especially as they relate to empire building both within and outside the academy. Then, we will explore the methods of literary critique, thinking about what is at stake in the objects we study and the ways we choose to read them. Finally, we will engage with challenges to the traditional organizing principles of our field, including its archives, geographies, periodization, theoretical interventions, and political stakes. In addition to our seminar session, we will have sessions that address the professional stakes of postgraduate life, including workshops in pedagogy, publishing, and navigating graduate studies.",

Through reading several collections of poetry and essays on poetry and historical memory, we will explore the intersections and rifts between larger histories (the stuff of cultural or public memory) and smaller, often subjugated or lost histories, and personal histories\u2014as well as the gaps in these histories, the willed forgetting and cultural amnesia often surrounding them. We will discuss and analyze the ways in which some poets have used history in their work as well as the particular formal strategies of their poems, conduct research for writing new poems, define strategies for using information gathered from our research, and produce portfolios of poems that engage public history and/or the intersections between public and personal history. Selected essays on poetry and history\u2014as well as a few collections of poems\u2014will serve as texts for the course.",

It's easy to fall into a rut, to think we're only capable of working in certain modes, and it's not true. We can do a lot more. We'll work through a series of exercises to generate material drawn from two seemingly disparate sources: the fantastical and our own lives. We will, of course, also discuss and help each other work through the material we're submitting; be prepared to read and annotate closely. But we'll also come out with fresh stories as well as new approaches to our creative output, and we'll find constructive and supportive ways to sustain ourselves and our literary community. Writing can be hard, it can be stressful, but it doesn't have to be---not all the time, at least---and there is real joy involved. Let's get back to that joy.",

Rising sea levels and increasing ocean acidity, higher temperatures, more droughts, melting glaciers, wilder weather patterns, and mounting environmental disasters mean that climate change is increasingly visible in our daily lives. What role does human society play in these changes, and what consequences does society suffer as these changes occur? This course is an introduction to environmental sociology during which we will employ an intersectional, sociological perspective to look beyond the scientific basis for environmental problems to understand the social roots of environmental issues. We will cover a variety of topics in environmental sociology, including new directions in sustainable development and how actors such as corporations, the media, and social movements impact public opinion and environmental issues. Further, we will critically examine the gendered, racial, and socioeconomic production of disparate environmental risks.",

We will discuss satire and scepticism as modes for social commentary, situating our primary texts in their historical and political contexts. We will ask how the Renaissance defined itself against the religious, pedagogical, political, philosophical and literary norms of previous centuries. Why did images of giants, cannibals, monsters and imaginary places play such a critical role in redefining society in this period of intense political and religious upheaval? We will also use that long-ago past to examine the ways in which those norms and prejudices continue to affect everyday life today. This course will be taught in English.",

Taking an interdisciplinary approach drawing on the social sciences and global/public health, the course identifies the main actors, institutions, practices and forms of knowledge production characteristic of what we call \"global health\" today, exploring the environmental, social, political and economic factors shaping patterns and experiences of illness and healthcare across societies. We will scrutinize the value systems that underpin specific paradigms in the policy and science of global health practice, and place present-day developments in historical perspective. As an introductory course on global health, the class delves into comparative health systems, including in high- and low-income countries. Key topics will include: policies and approaches to global health, key actors in global health, comparative health systems, structural violence, gender and reproductive health, chronic and communicable diseases (including pandemics), politics of global health research and evidence, and the ethics of global health equity.",

We will explore contemporary illness experiences and therapeutic interventions in context through case studies from the US, Brazil, and South Africa. Students will be introduced to key concepts such as embodiment, medicalization, structural violence, the social determinants of health, and biopolitics. Central questions of the seminar include: How do social categories of difference determine disease and health in individuals and collectivities? How is medical science influenced by economic and political institutions and by patient mobilization? How does social and economic inclusion/exclusion govern access to treatment as well as care of the self and others? The course will provide advanced instruction in anthropological and related social scientific research methods as they apply to questions of social inequality and public health policy. he course draws from historical accounts, contemporary ethnographies, public health literature, media reports, and films.",

    "ClassOverview": "Global health is a popular field of work and study for Americans, with an increasing number of medical trainees and practitioners, as well as people without medical training, going abroad to volunteer in areas where there are few health care practitioners or resources. In addition, college undergraduates, as well as medical trainees and practitioners, are going abroad in increasing numbers to conduct research in areas with few healthcare resources. But all of these endeavors, though often entered into with the best of intentions, are beset with ethical questions, concerns, and dilemmas, and can have unintended consequences. In this course, students will explore and consider these ethical challenges. In so doing, students will examine core global bioethical concerns - such as structural violence - and core global bioethical codes, guidelines, and principals - such as beneficence and solidarity - so they will be able to ethically assess global health practices in a way that places an emphasis on the central goal of global health: reducing health inequities. With an emphasis on the ethical responsibility to reduce inequities, we consider some of the most pressing global bioethical issues of our time: equity, fairness, and planetary health. Particular attention is given to the ethics of research during a pandemic and equitable access to vaccines and therapies for Covid-19. Beatriz will not be use ungrading for this course but each student will create an assignment bundle.",

    "ClassOverview": "Since the early 2000s, there has been an explosion of interest in volunteering in low-income communities: within orphanages, clinics, schools, conservation projects, refugee camps, and housing projects. At the same time, volunteering has become a significant issue of public debate, as unintended consequences of people's best intentions are brought to light in the popular press and in academic literature. This class explores the ethics of altruism through the discourses and practices that make up volunteering and voluntourism, from the perspectives of volunteers, hosts, and a range of others both promoting and critiquing volunteerism. What motivates people to volunteer among strangers or in unfamiliar contexts, and what are the implications of these voluntary exchanges for the volunteers, and for the communities and institutions where volunteering takes place? What are the ethics and values that make up \"making a difference\" among differently-situated players involved in volunteering? Given that volunteers often act upon best intentions, what are the logics and values that justify altruistic action, and the differential standards by which volunteers are judged based on where they go and how they engage in volunteering? What kinds of unintended consequences come about through voluntary action? This class highlights the need go beyond the adage \"any help is better than no help at all,\" and instead bring critical thinking to altruistic intentions.",

We will consider forms of storytelling\u2014including literature, film, and theater\u2014across eras and cultures, tracking shifts in perspectives on normality and pathology and their consequences for the most vulnerable. How does the power of Western psychiatry intersect with that of global media to reinforce reigning paradigms and imperatives for how suffering is to be understood, classified, and experienced? Conversely, what counter-narratives are being produced by artists and their communities? What role can the arts play in individual and collective forms of healing\u2014or in exacerbating pain and grievance? What kinds of voices seem to have power, and which are neglected? Where is the line between cathartic and exploitative representation of trauma and mental illness? How, in short, do the stories we tell about mental illness \"get under the skin\" and shape forms of suffering and care?",

    "ClassOverview": "This class will take a look at the life and work of the groundbreaking Viennese psychologist Sigmund Freud from a comparative and interdisciplinary angle. Almost 80 years after his death, Freud's legacy continues to be controversial: some claim that his theories are no longer relevant in the light of new research, whereas others defend his theories and/or expand upon the implications and influence of his ideas, in the realm not only of psychology, medicine, and neuroscience, but also in the fields of sociology, cultural studies, philosophy, literary studies, criminal justice, queer studies, women's studies, communications, and many more. What is certain, however, is that, one way or another, Freud's theories and ideas have marked the world for all time. This class will read fundamental texts from Freud's body of work in dialogue with texts by Freud's near and distant predecessors and followers, both to situate Freud in his historical and cultural context, and to think through the many different kinds of questions that Freud's work addresses.",

The shtetl is the central locus and focus of Modern Yiddish Literature; Fiddler on the Roof itself was based on a Sholem Aleichem story. In this seminar we shall explore the spectrum of representations of the shtetl in Yiddish literature from the nineteenth century to the post-Holocaust period. We shall also focus on artistic and photographic depictions of the shtetl: Chagall and Roman Vishniac in particular. The course will include a screening of Fiddler on the Roof followed by a discussion of this film based upon a comparison with the text upon which it is based, Tevye the Milkman.",

We will also consider certain themes and issues that Expressionist art particularly addressed, including: urbanization and cosmopolitanization; capitalism and inequality; war and trauma; portrayals of extreme states such as violence, ecstasy, and mental illness; sexuality, desire, and the representation of women; horror and the occult; the role of ethnic and cultural minorities; the appeal of the exotic; and the exploration of new or marginal psychological realities.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course is a rigorous introduction to feminism's multiple intellectual and political traditions and genealogies within and outside the US at different historical junctures. The course emphasizes the rich debates that have been staged within feminism as feminists have labored to imagine other worlds in a variety of media and contexts. Our task is to understand how these varied feminist traditions have interrogated the same sites -- marriage and family, sexuality, reproduction, the nation and the state, work, liberation, and feminism itself - in radically different ways. Why are these the key areas that feminist theorists have focused on across time and cultural divides? How have feminists around the world imagined these spaces as both sites of oppression and potential venues for freedom?",

This course will analyze approaches to understanding gender norms and identity categories, as well as consider experiences and contestations beyond these binaries. Particularly through reading trans, non-binary, and genderqueer histories, experiences, and politics, this class will consider the possibilities and problems of categorizing \"the beyond.\" We will discuss shifting conceptualizations of \"normal\" as it pertains to identity and embodiment, and what is assumed to defy this \"normal\" as embedded in the intersecting histories and legacies of race, class, sexuality, nationality, and ability. For instance, what is the relationship between race and gender that specifically shapes and forms the boundaries of gender in the United States? What possibilities and realities exist beyond the binaries of straight/gay, Black/white, abled/disabled, citizen/non-citizen?  How does power in social, cultural, and political arenas impact these discourses? This course aims to recognize and understand these contested histories through the lens of our current moment.",

The purpose of this course is to serve as a bridge between Hebrew second year and the advanced classes of Hebrew about literature and culture (Hebrew 216) or about Israeli media (Hebrew 245). In this class students will learn the future tense forms, the imperative and the conditional forms, advanced connectors (such as \u05dc\u05db\u05df, \u05de\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9 \u05e9..., \u05d1\u05d2\u05dc\u05dc), impersonal phrases with infinitive forms, more prepositions, the condensed form of possessive. Students will also expand their cultural proficiency by learning and practicing various everyday experiences like going to the doctor, buying clothes or electronics in the store, preparing for a trip, going to a concert, volunteering, or taking care of pets. The class will be built around the topic of leisure and hobbies, and the grammatical structures will be introduced and practiced through the various sub-topics we will learn about such as trips, favorite tv shows, movies and music, students' hobbies, and more. Class will consist of interactive exercises for the high intermediate learner, texts and visual materials in a level-appropriate difficulty with more information on Israeli daily life and reality and listening in the form of songs and clips in Hebrew.Hebrew 211 is a quarter-long class, planned to take place during the Fall out of the assumption that students who finished the second year in the previous spring will be able to expand their Hebrew knowledge and skills so they will be better equipped to take more advanced classes in the 200 level (Hebrew 216, 245) that are given in the following winter and spring quarters. For students who placed out of Hebrew due to their previous experience with Hebrew, this class can be helpful in reviewing forms and vocabulary they learned long ago, and in practicing active usage of the language (through class discussions, presentations, etc.) so they will be able to transition smoothly to the more advanced Hebrew classes.",

Topics might include climate change, abortion, global pandemics and their aftermath, racial justice, economic inequality, labor activism, transgender rights, immigration, and the global far-right. We will look at current events and develop the skills to place them in historical context; consider the use and misuse of historical analogies; and understand ourselves as people within history and shaped by the historical context around us. We will also try to think about what the future might find significant about our own time.Students will learn historical thinking skills, critical reading, and argumentation, and will complete a final assignment geared towards providing historical context for an ongoing debate in the public sphere.",

Instead, they are deeply political and profoundly man-made. This course adopts a historical and global approach in order to denaturalize disaster. From famines in British India to earthquakes in post-colonial Peru, from floods in New Orleans to nuclear disaster in Japan, we will see how disasters expose and exacerbate pre-existing inequalities, inflicting suffering disproportionately among those groups already marginalized by race, class, gender, geography, and age. These inequalities shape not only the impact of the disaster but the range of responses to it, including political critique and retrenchment, relief and rebuilding efforts, memorialization, and planning - or failing to plan - for future disasters of a similar kind. The course culminates in a unit on the contemporary challenge of anthropogenic global climate change, the ultimate man-made disaster.

From famines in British India to earthquakes in post-colonial Peru, from floods in New Orleans to nuclear disaster in Japan, we will see how disasters expose and exacerbate pre-existing inequalities, inflicting suffering disproportionately among those groups already marginalized by race, class, gender, geography, and age. These inequalities shape not only the impact of the disaster but the range of responses to it, including political critique and retrenchment, relief and rebuilding efforts, memorialization, and planning - or failing to plan - for future disasters of a similar kind.

We will ask why and how entrepreneurs as various as Josiah Wedgwood, Madame C.J. Walker, Jamsetji Tata, and Aristotle Onassis exploited opportunities that other people either failed to see or failed to act on.  Among the subjects we'll discuss are the strengths and weaknesses of family firms, the search for capital, resource extraction and depletion, and the dynamics of globalization and deglobalization.",

For example, despite the insistence that heterosexuality was ordained by God, the disparagement of physicality and women led to the institutionalization of clerical celibacy in the West. This, in turn, fostered a gay subculture. Likewise, despite the theoretical insistence on a separation between the sexes that was even present in the afterlife, these same theorists not only praised \"virile women,\" but occasionally celebrated cross-dressing in female saints!

    "ClassOverview": "Since the advent of the Four Modernizations under the aegis of Deng Xiaoping in late 1978, Chinese society, culture, economy\u2014indeed, almost every aspect of life\u2014have been transformed. At the same time, however, the country's Maoist and more distant Republican and Imperial pasts have continued to inform and shape reform. This course examines the complexities of China's reformist period from the late 1970s until ca. 2014. We will highlight key currents, such as the transformation of rural-urban relations, domestic arguments about the unevenness and morality of socio-economic change, the 1989 Spring Democracy Movement, China's \"Peaceful Rise,\" and its growing participation in global affairs, with an eye to understanding new social formations and highlighting the resonance of the past. Topics include The Four Modernizations; the transformation of rural-urban relations and domestic arguments about the unevenness and morality of socio-economic change; \"Floating\" and otherwise living in the city; SARS, AIDS, and the politics of public health; the Sichuan earthquake and civil society; China in the World; the rise of the popular environmental movement; unemployment and the growth of the new welfare state; and the 2014 Umbrella Movement.  At the 19th Congress of the Communist Party in 2017, Xi Jinping, declared that the current \"New Era\" had dawned. The Reform Era is thus truly the history of present moment.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course is designed to introduce graduate students to the main issues that they will confront as history teachers. It is not designed as TA training, but as an opportunity to engage with the most substantive questions that arise in teaching history and to acquire the skills necessary for teaching standalone courses, including designing syllabi and giving lectures. Compared to other graduate seminars, the footprint of this course will be light: it meets only every other week and reading assignments are relatively short. This course is recommended for students to take in their third years and is ideal preparation for teaching seminars and for the job market.",

How do our social experiences, stereotypes, and attitudes mediate how we speak and how we listen? And how much control do we have over these processes?

Understand the current state of the field of sentence processing.- This will be studied through readings and lectures.2. Understand what type of experiments and analytical skills have been used in the study of sentence processing.- This will be studied through homework and two exams.

Thus, the main focus of the course is on learning how to do syntax, and secondarily on learning a particular theory of syntax. No textbook will be used, and there will be minimal reading assignments; instead, the course will proceed on the basis of class discussion and weekly written assignments. Although the primary source of linguistic data will be English, examples will also be drawn from other languages both in class and on the assignments.",

Who learns mathematics, and why are U.S. mathematicians disproportionately male and white? How do race, gender, and other identities affect mathematics, mathematics education, and more generally STEM and society at large? Using academic writings, articles, movies, and other media, in this class students explore racism, sexism, and other systems of power, with particular attention on anti-Black racism.  We collaboratively create an anti-racist framework, and we use this framework to understand how privilege has shaped society, academia, and mathematics. Can mathematics become a field that is equally open to anyone? If so, how?",

We will start with the examples of the shift map, the tent map, and the logistic family to introduce the concept of chaos, and explore further properties of chaotic behaviors through Lyapunov exponents, conjugacy, and bifurcations. Additional topics to be covered include fractals, self-similar dimensions, complex dynamics, and an exploration of Julia sets and the Mandelbrot set. We will also make frequent use of computation technology to augment our understanding and inspire our mathematical investigations.The prerequisite of this course is a course in linear algebra. The course will also assume some familiarity with computer programming, and many of the homework assignments will involve simple programming in Mathematica.",

We will start with the examples of the shift map, the tent map, and the logistic family to introduce the concept of chaos, and explore further properties of chaotic behaviors through Lyapunov exponents, conjugacy, and bifurcations. Additional topics to be covered include fractals, self-similar dimensions, complex dynamics, and an exploration of Julia sets and the Mandelbrot set. We will also make frequent use of computation technology to augment our understanding and inspire our mathematical investigations.The prerequisite of this course is a course in linear algebra. The course will also assume some familiarity with computer programming, and many of the homework assignments will involve simple programming in Mathematica.",

    "ClassOverview": "Math 520 -- Topics in Mathematical PhysicsI will begin by giving an overview of the area (more on that below), but after that my goal for this course is that the students learn by preparing presentations and by actively querying one another.   The general area was determined in coversation with some students, but if you have a strong desire for a nearby topic we may be able to accommodate.  Rules of the game:  student presentations must provide context and must contain concrete examples to illustrate the main principles (speakers will not be allowed to \"not have time\" to get to the examples!).The subjects will be cluster varieties, knots, and their relation to physics.Some promising models of string theory reduce in four dimensions to N=1 or N=2 supersymmetric theories.  These theories have \"BPS states\" with enhanced symmetries, whose enumeration and interaction can often be described mathematically, and often in more ways than one, leading to dualities.  Notable BPS states are \"branes.\"  Categories of branes and their moduli of objects play a key role in elucidating the mathematical structure from physical theoreis.  For us, the mathematical stand-in for brane categories will be categories of constructible sheaves with singular support defined by a Legendrian variety --- for example, the boundary of a knot conormal.  These categories are invariants of the Legendrian up to Legendrian isotopy.Foundational work on the above mathematics was provided by Kashiwara, Schapira and Guillermou.  We will be more concerned with various applications, where moduli of objects can be identified with various cluster varieties, especially those of Fock and Goncharov.Here are some topics that students might explore.  A main goal of the course will be to thread them together.*  DT invariants of quivers (mathematically and as an effective theory of intersecting branes -- various papers, e.g. Kontsevich-Soibelman [COHA] and Cordoba-Cecotii-Vafa, others )* Cluster varieties and their quantization, especially those of Fock-Goncharov:  framed local systems on surfaces.  (Goncharov-Shen survery paper)* Cluster varieties and \"curves on surfaces.\"  (Shende-Treumann-Williams)* Clusters and braids (Casals-Gorsky-Gorsky-Shen-Simental)* The chromatic Lagrangian inside the cluster variety of framed local systems on surfaces.

    "ClassOverview": "NEUROSCI 202-0 introduces students to the cellular and molecular processes that allow the nervous system to produce behavior, with a focus on how electrochemical signals are generated, communicated, and integrated to transform different sensations into appropriate actions. We all want to know how the mind works in health and what happens when things go wrong in disease. However, first we need to start with the fundamentals, which this course will provide. Learning about neuroscience is like learning a new language, which will require the introduction of new words and the memorization of terminology. Students will be expected to increase their vocabulary so that they can begin to appreciate and discuss neuroscience concepts and research in an informed manner. This is not a survey course, rather it is designed to provide a solid foundation for subsequent coursework that delves more deeply into various topics in neuroscience.Prerequisites: Must be a neuroscience major, and BIOL_SC 201-0.Course content is divided into three sections. The first third focuses on the ionic and molecular basis of  generating electric signals in neurons. The second third focuses on electrical and chemical communication between neurons, how these connections are adjusted, and how they develop. The final third focuses on simple circuits that illustrate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that allow us to taste, smell, see, hear, feel and move.NEUROSCI 202-0 will be offered again Fall 2023 and Winter 2024.",

Special emphasis will be placed on the neural basis for the generation of circadian rhythms and on the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle.  The importance of biological rhythms for human health and disease will be covered in this course.  Much of this course will involve the analysis and discussion of classic and recent experiments that have been carried out in the study of biological clocks and the control of the sleep-wake cycle.

Good arguments are structured so that their conclusions are guaranteed to be true when the premises are true; bad arguments are not.

Truth-functional logic concerns arguments involving \"and,\" \"or,\" \"if,\" and \"not.\" First-order logic builds on truth-functional logic to concern complex arguments involving \"every\", \"none,\" and \"some.\" Since this course satisfies the FD-EDR degree requirement, students should expect a rigorous class with weekly assignments and quizzes.",

    "ClassOverview": "In a slogan, logic is about what follows from what. It concerns when information is guaranteed to be true because of how it is related to other true information. To learn a logic is to learn a formal language with its own rules (like a math or programming language), and to develop skill using this formal language. A logic is then used to figure out whether arguments are good or bad in roughly two steps. First, the argument is represented in a logic. Second, the argument is assessed by seeing whether it is constructed in a way where the argument's conclusion follows. Good arguments are structured so that their conclusions are guaranteed to be true when the premises are true; bad arguments are not. In this course, you will learn two logics: truth-functional logic and first-order logic.

    "ClassOverview": "Eighteenth-century Britain saw an explosion of interest in aesthetics: many thinkers leapt to investigate beauty and sublimity, imitation and emotion in art, artistic creativity, and so forth. A major reason for this interest was the cynical account of human nature, morals and politics promoted by Thomas Hobbes and Bernard de Mandeville: that human beings are solely motivated by self-interest, and that morals and politics are merely tools of social control, aimed to limit and redirect self-promoting human impulses. Many thinkers argued in response that human attractions to beauty and art were powerful counterexamples to that portrayal of human nature, showing that human beings can love objects and others for their own sakes, and in a way that calls them to social harmony, perhaps through eliciting sympathetic responsiveness. In this course, we will read and talk about central texts and issues in this discussion, moving from Mandeville's Fable of the Bees to several major responses to his cynical challenge in the British aesthetics tradition: Shaftesbury's high-minded view of beauty as rational order eliciting disinterested pleasure; Hutcheson's theory of humor as cognitive and morally corrective (not mockery or ridicule); Kames' view of art, including tragedy, as arousing sympathetic emotional responses; and Adam Smith's and Sophie de Grouchy's views of art, morality, and politics as grounded in sympathetic imagination. In addition to discussing their claims concerning the importance of art for understanding human nature and morality, we will discuss questions such as: does appreciation of art and beauty require education, or contribute to moral and political education, or both? How does representational art (\"imitation\") arouse sympathetic emotion or understanding of diverse others? How is taste (for beauty or art) influenced by wealth, social class, or national identity?",

    "ClassOverview": "In this seminar, we will read some of the central, inaugurating texts of the philosophy of history in the European modern tradition, by Rousseau, Kant, and Herder, and discuss their various questions, including:  does history have an aim or purposes, and how could we know of it/them?  Is there historical progress, and if so, of what sort? Is there a central defining subject matter or \"spine\" for human history (such as political events, technology, cultures)?  Relatedly, we will also discuss questions - of philosophical anthropology, one might say -- that occupy these early thinkers concerning the relationship between history and nature, freedom, and rationality. For example:  is human history to be understood as part of or continuous with natural history (of all organisms, or of human organisms in particular)?  Is historical investigation therefore strongly akin to biological explanation, or based upon biological premises? Or does human freedom or rationality disrupt the claims of biology and nature - so that history (proper) is departure from nature, a break with (merely) biological processes? What, most broadly, makes human beings historical? Finally, we will also consider why these philosophers present their claims concerning human nature (philosophical anthropology) in speculative-historical, narrative form: what sorts of philosophical claims or projects might be promoted by this form of philosophizing? We will consider how these projects in philosophy of history may be connected to the philosophers' criticisms of the European colonial project and (related) European racist theorizing (historically contemporary to their work). We will conclude the course with excerpts from later discussions of the relation between philosophy and history, as a contrast case: Friedrich Nietzsche's debunking genealogy of morality, and Amia Srinavasan's reflections on the cogency of such genealogical arguments.",

    "ClassOverview": "\"Freedom\" is a basic term in Western culture, for it became the formal designation of the right way to live\u2014to think, to act, to exist\u2014through which European culture replaced the classical idea of the good life, which had consisted in the exercise of the virtues. At the same time, however, \"freedom\" is a thoroughly ambiguous and dubious word that, from the beginning of its function as a basic concept, contained implicit and explicit programs for new forms of domination, including domination in the relation of the self to itself, to the world, and to others.  For this reason, a critique of freedom is necessary.The seminar will focus on the idea that freedom exists only in becoming, that is, as \"liberation.\" For it is precisely this idea of liberation that underlies the dominant narratives of post-classical Western culture (and modernity in particular): liberation defines its notions of history, subjectivity, education, politics, the arts, etc. And it is therefore also the thought and process of liberation that most clearly exhibits the dialectical knot that links freedom and domination in their contradiction. From this perspective, processes of liberation will be examined in the seminar. We will ask, for example: what drives those processes?  How do they proceed?  How do they fail and/or how do they establish new orders of domination?The seminar will pursue these questions by examining a variety of methodological approaches. These include the following: the exploration of the putative Greek origin of Western freedom in the history of ideas (Meier, Patterson, Raaflaub); the systematic conceptualization of the relations between freedom, capacity, and habit (Arendt, Hegel); the psycho-social analysis of the entanglement between emancipation and domination (Fanon, Hartman); the relation between experience and liberation in aesthetic theories of freedom (Adorno, Blanchot, Heidegger, Nancy); and the question of the relation between religion and freedom (L\u00e9vinas, Santner).",

Is it a belief, a perception, an action, an emotion, or some combination of these?  How is valuing related to reasons and how is it related to the value of a thing?  Does it make sense to think of value as intrinsic or absolute, or is all value relational, value-for something?We will consider realist, constructivist, and fitting attitudes accounts of value and valuing.  And we will pay special attention to the case of the value of a person and the relationship between this and the reasons that we have to interact, and refrain from interacting, with others in various ways.",

Emphasis is placed on practical communication so that students should be able to function at a basic level in several authentic situations by the end of the year. This course will use Chicago as a laboratory for understanding Polish American spaces and offer students an opportunity to experience and use their Polish skills in real life.",

    "ClassOverview": "In this course we will analyze canonical political theoretical texts in conversation with contemporary U.S. jurisprudence and politics, paying special attention to themes of sovereignty, nationalism, war, the rule of law, speech, sex, race, religion, and resistance. The objective is for students to acquire the knowledge and competencies of a responsible citizen. This means that you should leave this class with the ability to think, write, and speak about political theories and their relation to laws and legal obligations, as well as strategies for supporting, challenging, or resisting prevailing political intuitions and their institutionalization. You should be able to understand and defend your own interpretations of political conflicts, violence, and law. To do so will require you to become familiar with key historical events relevant to contemporary debates about the rule of law, speech, and religion, to which much of the lectures will be devoted. Assigned readings include works by Plato, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Karl Marx, John Stuart Mill, Rosa Luxemburg, Frantz Fanon, and Carole Pateman. Please note: this class requires you read about 100 pages of political theory weekly, on average. This is a course for those who enjoy reading and discussing challenging texts. The authors assigned for this class wrote in very different times and contexts, and had different political priorities. Each week please reflect on whether the author's objective is a state with a primary goal of institutionalizing ideas about nationality; a state with the overriding objective of institutionalizing justice, or thwarting injustice; or a state whose power is instrumental to protecting individuals' safety, property, or flourishing. Which author's commitments and aspirations do you find most inspiring and most objectionable?",

The course will devote attention to theories of the family and intergenerational identities that animate attachments to race and nationality, as well as comparisons among deportation policies in different regions and epochs. Students will be required to listen to actual immigration hearings and write their analyses of two of these.Students must be able to observe at least three hours of immigration court hearings in downtown Chicago. The hearings are typically M-Th and start at 9 a.m. Professor will make information on observations available, but it is the responsibility of the student to go to court and complete the required observations.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course focuses on the forces shaping countries' foreign economic policies. Why do governments choose to protect some industries behind high tariff walls while leaving others exposed to the vagaries of international competition? Why do most countries in the world rely on the U.S. dollar for their primary reserve currency - and will the dollar continue to serve that function? Why have many countries removed barriers to cross-border financial flows - and what are the social and political consequences of global financial market openness? Does international trade and investment make military conflict less or more likely? Do economic sanctions even work? How have the series of economic crises over the past decade - the 2008-09 financial market meltdown in the U.S., the global credit crunch the followed, sovereign debt crises (in the Eurozone countries and elsewhere), and the severe, synchronized economic downturns that followed the eruption of the COVID-19 pandemic - shifted the distribution of global economic and political power? In this course we will develop an analytical toolkit to provide some insight into these and other questions, paying particular attention to evaluating the theoretical arguments with two types of evidence: qualitative and historical and quantitative and cross-national. The course is organized thematically. We start with an introduction to the study of International Political Economy (IPE) and explore why it is distinct from international economics; following the introduction to the course we will discuss the problem of international cooperation when national economic policies have spillover effects. The next three topics (weeks 2-6) are devoted to three of the main issue areas that concern IPE specialists: the politics of the international trade, monetary, and financial systems. We then turn our attention to economic development strategies pursued by low- and middle-income countries and the role of foreign development aid in promoting growth. The last two weeks of the course are devoted to the relationship between transnational economic linkages and conflict and to the rise of new economic powerhouses (namely, China) and the possible consequences of this shift for American influence in global economic affairs.",

This does not mean that within capitalism there are not robust debates over how it should be run; ranging from what I might flippantly call, \"capitalism with a human face\" or \"capitalist democracy\" on one hand and \"market fundamentalism\" on the other. This era is often referred to as neo-liberal based on a certain understanding of the18th century liberalism of Adam Smith et alia. The first part of this class will be on the assumptions of capitalism and their historical roots (wealth, Christianity, profit, the market to name but a few); the opposition of Karl Marx, and the categories of Max Weber (essential for understanding the \"firm \"and authority). The second part will be the debates over the market and case studies of market failures and their social implications for people's lives. Finally, we will look at one analysis of how opposition to this stage of capitalism might look in the 21st century.",

The topics we will cover include research methods, the biology of behavior and emotion, perception, memory, thinking and problem solving, emotion, social influences on behavior, personality, and psychological disorders. A combination of class lectures, readings, and laboratory experiences will convey a sense of the foundational questions and methods of the science of psychology. Ultimately, the goal of this course is to impart an initial understanding of some fundamentals of human nature and behavior, as well as instill knowledge of the science of psychology. To this end, several hours of a laboratory experience are required across the quarter to allow you to have firsthand experience of the way research is conducted in psychology. Alternatively, a paper (requiring roughly the same number of hours outside of class) reviewing primary research articles in psychology may be substituted for the laboratory experience. If you are under the age of 18, you must use the paper requirement to satisfy your laboratory credit.",

What are the controversies in the field of psychology, and how might we as researchers overcome them?This course covers the how of psychological research. Scaffolded by the scientific method and informed by contemporary challenges and controversies in the field of psychology, we will work in small research teams to empirically investigate a psychological topic of interest from start to finish. This includes brainstorming a study, conducting a literature review, designing an experiment, considering the ethical constraints, recruiting participants and collecting data, analyzing said data, and writing up and disseminating the findings.In the first part of the class, we will complete two mini research projects before jumping into our own independent research projects for the latter half of the class. The entire class is project-oriented and hands-on, and feedback and support are provided at every step. As we engage in our research projects, we will also become acquainted with psychological research issues and controversies in the field. Our class design will mirror the format of most psychology labs, as we will be expected to (and will be evaluated on our capacity to) work collaboratively and communicate with our research teams. Moreover, our major class assignments-including the APA research papers and conference presentation-are all part and parcel of the everyday work of a psychology researcher. Course readings may include some journal articles and podcasts in addition to the open-source textbook: Research Methods in Psychology, 4th edition (ISBN 13: 9781999198107).",

    "ClassOverview": "This course provides a broad overview of social psychology revolving around one general question: In what ways do our social relations affect who we are and how we act? In approaching this question, we will examine three basic social motives, \"Belonging\", \"Understanding\", and \"Controlling\", and explore how these motives influence how we explain our own and others' behaviors, how we form and change our attitudes and opinions, how we are influenced by the groups to which we belong, and what compels us to help or hurt those with whom we interact. At the end of the course, we will then discuss some ways in which the answers to these questions are relevant for addressing a variety of social problems. Course meetings will primarily consist of multimedia lectures with as many impromptu discussions as I am able to inspire. The course will involve both asynchronous activities (e.g., videos, exercises) for you to complete on your own and twice weekly synchronous meetings where we will discuss the material in more depth. To facilitate engagement, there will also be periodic \"quizzes\" and discussions using the classroom interaction systems TopHat and Packback, so even if you don't like talking in big groups, you will still have opportunities to participate. Evaluation will also be based on short-answer questions that you will complete weekly and submit online. You will prepare the answers to these questions using your class notes, textbook, or any other outside sources you choose. There will also be a take-home final-exam that covers all of the material in the course due during finals week.",

Also, we will study how these issues shape the experiences of social group members, especially when they are members of low-status and/or minority groups.  In order to explore these topics, we will primarily focus on large societal groups that differ on dimensions of identity such as race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and religion.  Rather than relying on anecdotal evidence, cultural truisms, or philosophical orientations to address these issues, we will approach these issues wearing the hat of an experimental social psychologist.  That is, we will examine traditional and contemporary theories of stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination, punctuated by empirical findings.  Finally, we will apply the theoretical and empirical work to current events and issues.",

Rather, most faculty tend to use - and expect their advanced undergraduate students to use - one of the many computer software packages that are available for this purpose. Thus, this course will have two major foci. First, we will introduce advanced topics not covered in many sections of Introductory Statistics such as Multiple Regression and Factorial Analysis of Variance. Second, we will introduce the student to perhaps the most widely used computer software package in this area, the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS).",

In the United States, partisanship has surged in recent decades, especially in terms of disdain for opposing partisans. Although such trends are complex and multiply determined, psychology affords a particularly expansive vantage point for making sense of them. This course provides a graduate-level survey of moral and political psychology to help us understand today's politicians and the body politic. By the end of the course, students should be knowledgeable about, and capable of generating original research in, this research space.",

    "ClassOverview": "Learning Spaces, Learned BodiesThis is a College Seminar on the relationship between the body, space, and learning. While education and college are often presented as primarily intellectual activities, we will pay attention to the spatial and bodily dynamics that shape how we create, share and access knowledge. Using a range of creative assignments and multi-modal interdisciplinary sources, we will approach the body and space as places where learning happens, and therefore as categories through which we can analyze how learning happens, including in our very own classroom and on campus. Students will learn to ask how the body shapes and is shaped by its learning environment through categories like gender/sex and sexuality, race/ethnicity and religion, ability and access, and how fields like architecture, design, technology and media influence the enterprise of learning. Students will learn to re-examine their most basic assumptions about learning in a variety of expected and unexpected settings, like libraries and maker spaces, rabbinic bathrooms and football fields, science labs and ancient Greek life, in order to prepare for a range of learning experiences that they may encounter at Northwestern, and beyond. The course will guide students to be more attuned to the social and material dynamics that may otherwise go unrecognized in these experiences, teaching critical skills that will prepare them to be more conscious learners. It will appeal to students with a wide-range of academic interests across the humanities, arts and sciences, and to anyone interested in asking big questions about learning through different time periods and fields of study.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course offers an introduction to Buddhist history, culture, philosophy, and practice. We explore the major doctrinal varieties of Buddhism, from its inception through the rise of the Mahayana and Tantric or Vajrayana traditions. At the same time, we also investigate Buddhist visual, material, and ritual cultures\u2014which offer windows onto aspects of Buddhism as a lived religion not always visible in scriptural sources. In the process we engage themes like the meaning of suffering, the cosmology of cyclical rebirth, the social role of monasticism and its intervention in traditional family structures, the place of women and gender in Buddhism, the relationship between religious ideals and everyday life, the question of self-reliance versus divine assistance, and the power of images and icons. Our readings of primary sources offer close engagement with Buddhist ideas and practices, allowing us to understand how the religion shaped the ways people in pre-modern Asia saw and interacted with their worlds. Readings in secondary scholarship help us set these materials in historical context and connect them to the bigger picture of Buddhism's spread across Asia.",

In the process we engage themes like the meaning of suffering, the cosmology of cyclical rebirth, the social role of monasticism and its intervention in traditional family structures, the place of women and gender in Buddhism, the relationship between religious ideals and everyday life, the question of self-reliance versus divine assistance, and the power of images and icons. Our readings of primary sources offer close engagement with Buddhist ideas and practices, allowing us to understand how the religion shaped the ways people in pre-modern Asia saw and interacted with their worlds.

    "ClassOverview": "The fragility of the human body, its susceptibility to illness and death, provoked a wide array of responses among religious practitioners in pre-modern China. Some pursued supernatural longevity and even immortality through various regimes of self-cultivation. Others, by contrast, renounced the body in part or whole through dramatic acts of self-immolation. Even in death, however, many aspired to rebirth in heavenly realms where bodies do not grow old and die, but rather live forever in bliss. This course examines these various attempts to overcome death in Chinese religion\u2014including Buddhism, Daoism, and traditions that fall between these large categories\u2014seeking to understand how the mortality of the body was used to authorize particular modes of embodied living. In the process, we will explore how these modes of religious life shaped attitudes toward food, medicine, gender, sexuality, and family.Counts towardsReligion, Health and Medicine (RHM)andReligion, Sexuality and Gender (RSG)major concentrations.",

Poland's shifting borders and the complex history and politics they represent provide a unique point of entry into modern European history.  In this course, we will explore the distinctive ways in which history and culture combine in a colonized nation at Europe's heart by way of novels, films, essays, memoirs, journalism, and poetry.  Authors to be read will include Nobel Laureates Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz, Wis\u0142awa Szymborska, and Olga Tokarczuk.",

Indeed, translation from such sources plays a key role in the development of modern Russian poetry.  How then did poetry come to be perceived as the \"prestige\" genre in Russian culture, literary and otherwise?  What role did poetry play in the formation of nineteenth century Russian national identity?  We will address such questions through specifics of verse structure and language from the Golden Age of the early 19th century to the later \"Age of Prose.\"",

Often these social processes go unobserved or unacknowledged, and sociologists treat it as their job to shed analytical light on how people experience and participate in society. Through sociological analysis, we can answer questions like: How did Evanston become largely segregated by race? Why is it illegal for people to sell their kidneys? Is suicide contagious? Why would someone pay for Instagram followers?Sociology is a huge field of study, and includes an enormous variety of topics and methods. Each week, we will focus on a specific area of sociological study (Culture, Gender, Race, Family, Money, Deviance, etc.) with the goal of offering you a general overview of the types of questions sociologists ask and how they answer them. By the end of the quarter, you will be able to think sociologically about your own world, and hopefully develop a budding interest in one or more of the areas we discuss in class.",

Rising sea levels and increasing ocean acidity, higher temperatures, more droughts, melting glaciers, wilder weather patterns, and mounting environmental disasters mean that climate change is increasingly visible in our daily lives. What role does human society play in these changes, and what consequences does society suffer as these changes occur? This course is an introduction to environmental sociology during which we will employ an intersectional, sociological perspective to look beyond the scientific basis for environmental problems to understand the social roots of environmental issues. We will cover a variety of topics in environmental sociology, including new directions in sustainable development and how actors such as corporations, the media, and social movements impact public opinion and environmental issues. Further, we will critically examine the gendered, racial, and socioeconomic production of disparate environmental risks.",

Why do most administrative forms only have two categories (i.e. Male and Female)? Why do male doctors, on average, have higher incomes than female doctors?  The course introduces students to the sociological analysis of gender as a central component of social organization and social inequality in the US context.  We start by reviewing key sociological concepts that are important to the study of gender.  Next, we explore the causes and consequences of gender inequalities in important social institutions such as the family, the education system, and the labor market. We conclude by considering gender inequality in an international comparative context to understand crosscutting similarities and differences between the US and both high- and low-income contexts.  This allows us to explore the role social norms and policies play in perpetuating and/or mitigating gender inequalities.",

The course asks what is \"race,\" and how does it function in Europe, Asia, Africa, Latin America, the U.S. and Oceania. And since racial concepts are not stable across time or place, how is \"race\" transformed by transnational migration and global cultural exchange. In exploring these ideas, the course also pays attention to intersecting formations of class, gender, ethnicity, region, etc. The goal of the course is to destabilize the concept of race by looking at its transformations across time and place, and to understand manifestations of racism and struggles against it across a range of geopolitical contexts.",

    "ClassOverview": "What do we do about a world that doesn't conform to our expectations? Do we set out to mold reality to our vision or accept it as it is? How do we forge ahead with our dreams if others do not share our values or goals? Cervantes' Don Quixote tackles these big questions in ways that are both moving and funny as it narrates the adventures of the bedraggled hero--a man driven mad by reading too many fantasy novels--and his earthy sidekick Sancho Panza. The novel contains themes that resonate with our lives today, exploring not only what it means to write--and read--fiction but also asking us to evaluate what kind of person we want to be in the world. In our class, we'll read the novel closely and debate how its essential questions can shape our personal choices moving forward.",

Although the new narrative is often identified with Boom novels (such as One Hundred Years of Solitude) and with the Boom era overall\u2014when Latin American literature \"exploded\" onto the world stage--we will take a broader view to consider the diverse types of narrative representing \"new\" currents in the region. Primary materials will be selected from writers such as Borges, Cort\u00e1zar, Donoso, Ferr\u00e9, Fuentes, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Mench\u00fa, Puig, Rulfo, Shua, Timerman, or Valenzuela.",

The purpose is that the students improve their language and critical analysis skills, while familiarizing themselves with the most important aesthetic and political currents of the last centuries in Spain through literature. We will think in and out of the canon of Spanish literature with a critical approach. Issues such as the construction and deconstruction of authorship, the audience, literary genres, avant-garde experimentation and censorship will be discussed. Novels, poetry, and plays are analyzed with an emphasis on the impact of empire and post-empire, feminism, anti-racism, queerness, and plurilingualism.

Specifically, we will study fanzines produced by the counter-culture, punk, queer and feminist groups in Spain since the end of the fascist dictatorship to the present (1975-today). We will study their relationship to mainstream literature through the reading of a contemporary classic novel that includes, and reflects on, fanzines, Cristina Morales's Lectura f\u00e1cil (2018). Topics addressed in the novel and the fanzines include disability, feminism, dance, mental health, and politics. Students will read this contemporary classic, will study diverse fanzines, and, in groups, will design, print, and distribute their own fanzines as final project. This class may include interviews with creators of fanzines and local visits in the Evanston/Chicago area. Prequisite: 1 course out of SPANISH 250-0, 251-0, 260-0, or 261-0.",

We will use this opportunity to explore questions essential to historical thinking: the nature of historical change and the challenges of studying continuity rather than rupture; processes of identity and community making and their archival traces; and the differences between history, historiography, memory work and nostalgia.

    "ClassOverview": "The purpose of this course is to provide an elementary introduction to a variety of computational algorithms for the Bayesian analysis of data. Two types of methods are considered in detail: observed data and data augmentation methods. The observed data methods are applied directly to the likelihood or to the posterior distribution. These include: Newton-Raphson, Monte Carlo and Metropolis methods. The data augmentation methods rely on an augmentation of the data which simplifies the likelihood or posterior distribution. These include: EM, Data Augmentation, and the Gibbs sampler. All methods are motivated and illustrated with real examples. Overall, this course provides the student with a good introduction to the field, the ability to read application papers, and the ability to apply these methods to problems of interest to the student. Students understand at a heuristic level how the methods work and when a given method may be preferred over another.",

Statistics 420-1 covers distribution theory. Distribution theory is concerned with probability distributions of random variables, particularly those concepts that arise frequently in statistical theory. The emphasis on this course is on the precise and careful statement of results and on the accurate determination of quantities such as moments, distribution functions, and so on, that are often used in statistical methodology. Prerequisites: A good background in calculus, real analysis (e.g., the concept of a limit), linear algebra, elementary probability theory, and statistical methods.",
