Furthermore, our class conversations will touch upon the intersections of race, gender, national identity, and technology with music and sport. While this class does not utilize an assigned textbook, students will be expected to read articles and consider video examples in preparation for each meeting. Assignments will include a listening/reading journal, a take-home final exam, attendance at a sporting event, and a written report on said sporting event. No prior musical training is required to take this course.",

This course will primarily introduce students to the history of rock as a localized cultural practice.  Students will develop critical conceptual tools to engage with the aesthetics (both aural and visual) of rock from the 1950s to the early 2000s. We will question what people mean and do when they talk about rock, examine social movements associated with the genre, and discuss how these differ (or not) through time and location. Lectures will review album covers, video clips, concert recordings, and - more than anything - musical examples framed within the political, social, technological, and economic circumstances that undergird their aesthetic specificity. Students will write analytical essays, deliver an oral presentation, and engage in discussions. No prior knowledge of music is required for this course, but a love of rock is highly encouraged.",

The debates, and the topic of opera more generally, attracted some of the era's leadingphilosophesand other intellectual figures, too, including Jean-Jacques Rousseau (who also tried his hand at opera composition) and Denis Diderot. Further, scholars have shown that thequerelleswere never just about music: opera was entwined here with key political and philosophical debates of the age. In this course we will study several operas that were heard in Paris in the 18th century and played a role in thesequerelles, including Rameau'sHippolyte et Aricie, Rousseau'sLe devin du village, and the competing versions by Gluck and Piccinni ofIphig\u00e9nie en Tauride, among others.

Within an interdisciplinary context that involves visual art, Latin American history, baroque poetry, and religious studies, students will critically engage music genres such as the villancico and the Mass, including works by composers such as Hernando Franco, Francisco L\u00f3pez Capillas, Juan Guti\u00e9rrez de Padilla, Juan Garc\u00eda de C\u00e9spedes, Manuel de Sumaya, Antonio de Salazar, Santiago Billoni, and Ignacio JerusalemWe will also consider race and social status of musicians and publics and try to understand the political and religious contexts in which music was created. Methods will include engaging primary, unedited sources from Mexico City Cathedral, but also consider evidence about indigenous and European oral traditions. Finally, the class will situate the revival of these repertoires within the contemporary history of the early music movement and explore how performers reimagine the colonial past as a way to foster ideas of community and diversity in early music practice, regardless of historical authenticity. As such, the Latin Baroque is a contemporary construction. Knowledge of Spanish is helpful but not required.",

Prior knowledge of composition or music theory is not required. However, students will be required to perform or otherwise realize their composition assignments in class, so proficiency on a musical instrument or DAW is encouraged. Students should come to class with an open mind, ready to share their work and offer constructive feedback for their peers. The course does not focus on any single genre of music.",

Initially propelled by exponents of the Schenkerian theory, these advances were more recently fueled by representatives of the cognitive study of music, neo-Riemannian theory, and historical music theory, among others, and they brought about a rich inventory of analytical tools applicable to variety of musical repertoires. In this course we will review the most important theories of rhythm and meter developed in the last forty years and apply them in analysis of common-practice repertoire. This combination of theoretical inquiry and practical application of analytical methods is reflected in the course design, in which in-class discussion of readings will be followed by analytical exercises. The assessment will include preparation for and participation in the discussions, one presentation and two analytical papers.",

We will review the key historical moments of space exploration, the basic science of space, and the government's role in promoting space exploration as these factors have influenced the development of the business and law of space commerce.  We will further explore the overarching system of space law - from international law to national legislatures to regulatory frameworks - that has developed over the last half century to gain deeper understanding of the current space commerce environment.  We will consider the role of national security and the various U.S. agencies involved in space military and commercial activities and how the two are linked.  Upon completion of this course, students will have a strong grasp of the evolving business models for the industries of space commerce and the role and influence of relevant law.Additionally, you will visit several space companies in the Bay Area to gain insight into business-legal challenges that these companies are tackling, and you will work in three-to-four person teams (supervised by practicing space law experts), to closely analyze a business-legal problem of your choosing that is particular to space commerce.  There is a broad range of business-legal topics and issues that may be explored, including: geolocation, earth observation, and remote sensing; spectrum and spectrum alternatives; 3D robotics and artificial intelligence in space; satellite refueling and mission-extension services; launch innovations, such as reusable and multiple-payload launches and \"last mile\" boosters; high-throughput satellites delivering broadband internet, and nanosatellites connecting Internet-of-Things devices; on-orbit manufacturing; celestial body (asteroid) mining; and data gathering and procurement (including by governments and public-private partnerships).

    "ClassOverview": "This course will explore the highly active and sophisticated dealmaking environment of modern chapter 11 corporate restructurings, through the lens of how a distressed corporation, its board, and senior management plan and design the restructuring process. The course will lay the foundation for a robust understanding of corporate restructurings through three primary means: lectures; panel discussions; and a mock board exercise. Lectures will focus on the fundamental rights and obligations of debtors, creditors, and other parties in interest in the various types of major chapter 11 cases, providing critical insight into understanding the motivations, strategies, and available tools for chapter 11 participants. Understanding the perspective and alternatives of chapter 11 participants is critical for a corporation's directors and officers, guided by their restructuring professionals, to plan and design the process and substance of a distressed corporate restructuring, whether inside or outside of court. The course will pay particular attention to the unique fiduciary duties of director and officers during various planning and implementation stages of the restructuring process, and how disputes about those duties play themselves out in contemporary chapter 11 mega-cases. The course also will cover financial valuation methods used by stakeholders in evaluating distressed corporations, and how valuation outcomes impact the restructuring formulation process. Panels will bring together key participants from recent major chapter 11 restructurings to offer their real-world insights and perspectives into some of the most current issues in the field, how the debtor planned and designed the process, and whether the outcomes were as originally drawn up on the chalkboard. A mock board exercise (with outside restructuring professionals and principals serving as mock directors) will enable students to simulate the real-world experience of advising a board of a distressed company in considering its restructuring alternatives and how to design a restructuring process that can be implemented in manner that maximizes value for all stakeholders.",

    "ClassOverview": "A gradual reversal (or refinement) of former precedent is taking place at the NLRB now that the Board's General Counsel and a majority of the Board itself is more labor-friendly. We will see how that has played out in a number of the Agency's decisions, as well as arguments put forth by union and management. In this respect, long-standing labor law concepts are being questioned and legal precedent overruled -- e.g., NLRB and court rulings addressing whether college student athletes, graduate students, Uber and Lyft drivers, and adjunct faculty are eligible for union representation; the legal limitations placed on a company as it seeks to control what its employees view on their company computers; the once-expanding, then contracting, and now-expanding boundaries of protected concerted activity in our ever-changing social media universe. The NLRB also has issued new rules for union elections, which have been the subject of litigation and congressional criticism. Another recent development is the NLRB's focus on employer rules pertaining to social media policies and confidentiality regulations.New forms of worker representation are challenging the law and providing outlets for worker protest, such as fast food, home care and child-care workers in the Fight for $15 campaign that have been striking periodically for higher wages and a union. This campaign has been successful at raising the minimum wage in many states. These efforts are supported by existing unions and raise the possibility of broader sectoral unionization like that which exists in Europe, rather than the employer-by-employer organization contemplated by the National Labor Relations Act.",

We will follow the investment lifecycle from initial investment assessment to the acquisition and financing process to value creation to exit. We will discuss structuring transactions and key transaction terms, as well as critical governance matters. We will cover key topics that anyone working in the industry should understand as a business person or lawyer.  In particular, the course will teach you the core legal issues involved in each aspect of private equity investing, from the formation of private equity funds to the debt financing used to leverage private equity investments to the M&A and investment transactions themselves, including key specialized areas such as tax, executive compensation and intellectual property, and the exiting of these transactions to generate returns. The course will also teach you how to review and analyze a number of important documents involved in private equity transactions.  Lastly, the course will give you insight into a number of different commercial issues presented by private equity transactions and the manner in which these issues are negotiated.",

    "ClassOverview": "The first two thirds of the course will center largely on readings taken from M.B. Nimmer, P. Marcus, D.A. Myers and D. Nimmer, Cases and Materials on Copyright and Other Aspects of Entertainment Litigation, Eighth Edition, 2012, published by LEXIS/NEXIS. The latter one third portion of the course will center largely on selected cases and other source materials that will be available on Westlaw (or will otherwise be supplied or made available to you).Students should come to class having prepared the reading assigned for that class, ready for discussion. Informed discussion of the ideas embodied within the reading materials is one of the objects of this seminar.  Class participation will count towards the student's final grade.  For each class, a number of cases or materials, identified below, representing a portion of the assigned reading for that class will form the basis for the class discussion.  Familiarity with all of the assigned reading for that week, however, will be assumed. Each class session has designated \"Additional Readings\"; these are NOT mandatory or required in any way, but are helpful resources and will provide additional context for the materials discussed in that particular class.  Also, you can count on being advised of new developments during the semester via email and Canvas; as you will see, this is a volatile and dynamic area of the law. Class attendance is not mandatory but useful, given the wide-ranging nature of class discussions and the scheduled presentations; given that the class is a seminar, contributions by students form a material part of the class content.   Due to the class schedule and calendar constraints, we anticipate one or more \"make-up\" sessions during the semester.   You will be notified in advance of these sessions.  BE PREPARED for alterations in the scheduled class content; we may have outside guest-lecturers; you will get notice of these alterations.The principal course requirements will be (1) a paper (counting for approximately 70% of the final grade), on an approved topic, and (2) three graded, hands-on, practical projects, which will be administered in three different class sessions, counting for approximately 30% of the final grade.  As stated, class participation will figure in each student's final grade so that component will have some influence on class attendance.  Paper topics should be selected as early in the semester as possible.  Papers will be due not later than the last day of the exam period.",

    "ClassOverview": "Judge Learned Hand famously once remarked: \"Liberty lies in the hearts of men and women; when it dies there, no constitution, no law, no court can even do much to help it. While it lies there, it needs no constitution, no law, no court to save it.\"To be sure, Hand was hopeful that a fierce commitment to liberty - along with a constellation of other critical constitutional values -- did course within the American people, reflecting and cementing the protections provided under law. But if Hand's optimism was (and is) well-placed, it bears asking: How have these constitutional values been forged within American hearts, minds, and culture? How have public conversations, discussions, and debates about the meaning of the United States Constitution unfolded? And what might those exchanges, located in our past, reveal about how Americans view the Constitution's guarantees within their own lives today?This course, focused on American public constitutional discourse, will address these questions. Specifically, we will assess and compare the public persuasion dimensions of an eclectic series of constitutional controversies. Fusing legal history, rhetorical criticism, communication research, political science, and constitutional theory, we will analyze the public arguments advanced by advocates during these episodes, the methods used to do so, and their success or failure with key public audiences.We will also investigate the discursive manner by which Americans - in print and at the podium, and across legislative hearing rooms, law school classrooms, and family living rooms -- have built a constitutional culture, and the degree to which that public culture: (a) informs individual and community expectations regarding freedom, democracy, and equality; (b) reinforces core constitutional precepts of rights, judicial legitimacy, institutional balance, and the rule of law; and (c) reflects, invites, and shapes the exercise of citizenship.",

    "ClassOverview": "This is an introductory course that will teach you the fundamentals of how to translate the terms of a business deal into a straightforward and well-organized written contract. The course is not intended to teach you how to draft any particular type of contract (e.g., employment agreements, asset purchase agreements, limited liability company operating agreements), but rather to introduce you to the basic contract concepts and organizational structure that most negotiated commercial contracts share, as well as give you practice spotting issues in contracts drafted by others.Although you will be exposed to, and work with, existing agreements relating to previous deals and other types of contract \"precedent,\" the focus of the course will be on teaching original contemporary contract drafting. You will be taught how to draft agreements in a formal, but modern, style free of archaic language, redundancies, and legalese.",

Students will become familiar with the theoretical framework and findings of research on the legal profession and lawyers' careers, particularly from a sociolegal perspective; they also learn which areas have and have not been the subject of systematic study. We will draw on a range of sources during the semester, including case studies of law graduates' careers and in-class interviews of law graduates with experience in a wide variety of settings, as well as more traditional scholarship.",

Class sessions will involve both a lecture presentation from a faculty member on a discovery topic, and a breakout session in which students will gain experience in drafting discovery requests and responses, taking and defending mock depositions, and preparing and arguing motions on issues that litigators regularly confront, such as on electronic discovery preservation and document production. The breakout sessions will be taught by the group of adjuncts and they will rotate throughout the semester.Each student will be designated an \"\"A\"\" or a \"\"B\"\" for the purposes of the assignments. You will retain your designation for the entire semester. The exercise for this class will be drawn from the Taylor v Pinnacle Packaging case file. Students designated as \"\"A's\"\" will always represent Taylor. Students designated as \"\"B's\"\" will always represent Pinnacle Packaging. There will be an early add/drop deadline to facilitate the creation of litigation teams.\"",

Amicus brief to the Constitutional Court of Georgia, drawing from international law and comparative \"best practices\" to argue that victims of domestic violence have a right to a speedy means of obtaining a divorce.3. Report and submission to UN human rights mechanisms on US failures of investigation and accountability for gross human rights violations against Haitian migrants at Del Rio, Texas, including abuses by CBP officers on horseback, with NGO partners RAICES and Haitian Bridge Alliance.4.  Continuing advocacy efforts, as opportunities arise, on behalf of an Indigenous Guji community that is suffering devastating effects due to toxic contamination from the Lega Dembi gold mine.5.  Possible participation in advocacy at the UN in collaboration with EQUAL GROUND, a Sri Lanka LGBTIQ NGO, with whom we prepared two reports in Spring 2022. Review at UN has been postponed due to crisis in Sri Lanka, but is now scheduled for early 2023. 6. Continuing work (as needed) with the Geneva-based International Platform for Corporate Liability to organize a World Peoples' Tribunal on Climate Change and Corporate Liability, tentatively planned for 2023 in Dar es Salaam.One or two other projects may be added; student suggestions are welcome.",

US Companies and lawmakers are wildly unprepared, relying on outdated enforcement mechanisms and vows of companies who flout data protection.  Global issues of surveillance and propaganda are daily news.  Widespread use of AI in decision-making, revenge porn and deepfakes are commonplace. States react quickly, passing legislation which mimics GDPR and lights a fire under technology companies to lobby for Federal legislation to provide a preemption cover.  How did we get here?  This course will examine the tension between opposing approaches to privacy; how these laws came into being and some of their disparate, intended and unintended consequences. We will have a guest speaker from a Silicon Valley technology company who will discuss how these laws are put into practice in building the technology of tomorrow. By the end of the class you will understand the contours of data privacy in Europe and the US and the factors that have gone into the recent surge of interest in US consumer privacy.  You will also have a greater understanding of how companies struggle with the technology they create; its impact on privacy and how they manage it.",

Understand the important physical, chemical, and biological processes that regulate thedynamics of aquatic systems, the atmosphere, the land surface, and groundwater aquifers.2. Identify major contaminants of concern to human health and ecological health.3. Identify environmental resources necessary for modern society and evaluate constraints onsustainable development, such as ensuring ongoing access to sufficient high-quality watersupplies and avoiding long-term degradation of aquatic ecosystems.4. Identify primary sources of drinking water, and key microbiological and chemical parametersthat determine the suitability of water for drinking.5. Understand the regulatory framework for water and air quality.6. Summarize the major strategies used to remove contaminants from water and air, and howthose strategies have been implemented in treatment infrastructure.7.

    "ClassOverview": "This seminar will explore how the availability of water has shaped the development of civilizations and driven innovation in water technologies. The course will investigate historical dimensions of water in Israel and the Middle East, focusing on ancient civilizations and the water infrastructures that are essential tools in aiding the development of water-poor societies. We will use this historical context as a stepping-stone to transition into a more recent history of the Middle East, focusing on the challenges that the nascent state of Israel faced following the influx of millions of immigrants. We will then examine efforts to develop the necessary water resources needed to support the burgeoning population as we as the irrigation projects designed to convert barren desert land into cultivated agriculture. This more recent history will help to set the stage for discussions regarding geopolitical conflicts over land and water that continue to this day. We will evaluate regional climate and water in the context of current and future geopolitical conflicts, reviewing recent advances in water technologies spurred by these limitations as well as the potential development of combined social and technological solutions for long-term water sustainability in Israel and the Middle East. We will end the course with solutions developed in Israel to other water-poor regions. in addition, the course will host a symposium featuring international experts. It will explore how water access and control contributes to trans-boundary politics and how recent advances in Israel water technologies may serve as a model for sustainable water development in other water-poor regions of the world.",

The hope is not to necessarily become great artists, but rather learn to quickly and effectively communicate ideas with others. We are going to design things that are disruptive and imaginative in an effort to create the future, and in order to do so, we have to be able to help others see what we see.We will explore the process of generative ideation as fueled by design sketching as well as presentation methods for communicating design concepts effectively. We will focus on user experience, human emotion, form and the use of materials in design and develop multiple concepts across a range of industries. We will also imagine and develop ideas at a range of scales, from handheld products, to large architectural installations. We will also work to develop your unique sketching style and aesthetic.We will work in a studio culture involving a fast-paced work environment, peer-review, and an opportunity to learn from a wide variety of resources. Reading and exercises will be provided on a project-by-project basis and you will also be encouraged to explore other types of visual communication that you find interesting in the development of concepts.",

All issues relating to patents and patentability of inventions, copyrights and the protection of the expressions of ideas, trademarks and source identifiers will be reviewed and analyzed in the context of multiple engineering domains. While these domains will initially be functional (mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, industrial engineering, computer science, etc), we will explore how new combinations of traditionally functional knowledge (e.g. ME+CS, CS+CE, IE+CE\u2026) are the fertile areas of new commercial markets and wealth creation.",

The quarter culminates in a conceptual design and a design review. The second quarter focuses on project implementation and continued professional communication.The projects focus on the engineering side of design. While users are still a consideration, they are not the primary focus as in the Design Thinking and Communication (DTC) sequence.

What does it mean to us as thinkers, builders and makers?  How is it meaningful when it all seems so diffused and fuzzy and inconsistent?We will explore these three concepts: as separate notions, how they intersect and how different configurations can create value and even lead to similar outcomes. We will discuss various formal frameworks and contextualize them with real-world models, examples and stories. Guest speakers of diverse career backgrounds will share their own frameworks and stories. We will spot patterns, gain insights and build frameworks for our own paths forward in the world of design and innovation- a starting point from which each student can continually further iterate through their unique career path.",

To become a thoughtful and creative leader, we need to form connection with others and build strong relationships built on trust and belonging. Once these relationships have been formed, we progress into using empathy and strategic communication to continue to grow our own personal leadership and foster the strengths in each of our team members. This course will examine how communication and relationships are the foundation of leadership, and how we can be influential and ethical when leading others and ourselves toward state-of-the-art discovery and development.",

We will focus on verifying, or disproving, assumptions associated with various aspects of the startup including the customer, the product, and the business model. The course is designed for student teams (two or more people) that have identified a solid value proposition and an initial business model concept. Teams will use prototypes or Minimum Viable Product (MVP), as well as customer discovery methods to validate assumptions with target customers weekly. Each week, teams will create testing plans for the coming week and present findings from the previous week's engagement with customers. Specific focus is paid to the de-risking process and development of productive team dynamics. Throughout the journey, student teams will present and defend their progress and engage in mentoring sessions with seasoned entrepreneurs. At the end of the course, teams will have refined their business models and developed the skills and habits necessary to reduce risk and take their startup to the next level.",

    "ClassOverview": "In Employee Engagement and Leadership Communications, students will approach the subject of how to communicate strategically with employees so they help their organization accomplish its goals. Companies need to engage and persuade employees to be brand ambassadors with customers, the community where they work and among fellow employees. A key part of reaching employees results from effective leadership communications using trusted leaders.The world has changed over the past few years, making the task of aligning, engaging and motivating employees even harder. Today's workforce is more diverse and companies need to seek greater diversity and inclusion. There are different levels, education, ethnic and generational cohorts in most companies. There are different languages spoken (even in the United States, English may not be the primary language). Employees may be in one location or spread out around the globe, a growing number in virtual offices. Many companies expect to continue to offer greater flexibility after the threat of Covid 19 is over.Reaching employees and communicating with them requires a strategic approach along with a variety of skills. Students will learn how to understand a dynamic employee audience, how to determine what's important, how to create a workplace environment conducive to mobilizing the employees to act effectively and in concert, how to deal with change in the organization and in the work environment, and how to lead when there's a great deal of turbulence and uncertainty.Beyond the employees, companies need to be active participants within the communities where they operate. This requires an ability understand strategically which NGOs to reach out and collaborate with, and ways to collaborate to benefit both organizations. Often, employees want to participate because they know maintaining healthy communities helps them keep social structures functioning well. Millennials and Gen Z entering the workforce are looking for companies, which have strong social responsibility commitments and offer ways for employees to participate.",

In addition, it will also provide connections to corresponding international Indigenous environmental issues, and the responses and debates across science research, news and international policy contexts.The seminar focuses on how the media cover Native American environmental issues and how that coverage contributes to the formation of public opinion and public policy. The seminar provides the critical tools to analyze current environmental struggles; to understand the controversies within a cultural context; and to make informed decisions about issues that affect us all. The central case study of the seminar will be water and fishing rights for Indigenous Peoples, and how they are part of larger land rights issues.Over the past two decades the issue of tribal sovereignty has become front-page news. From major confrontations over pipelines affecting Tribal Reservations mobilizing Indigenous people and their allies around the world, to battles over whaling rights and mining of tar sands, to sulfide mining adjacent to Tribal Reservations, to disputed land claims in the Northeast and battles in the West over water, fracking, and grazing,  the rights of Native governments to exercise their sovereignty remains in the new century at the cultural, political, and legal core of American contemporary history.These and many more issues\u2014air and water quality standards, treaty rights, and land-into-trust\u2014have contributed to tension between Native and non-Native communities, and have become the subject of news reports, in both mainstream and tribal media. The goals of this seminar are to understand how tribal sovereignty and treaty rights inform contemporary environmental issues; to identify source selection, bias, and framing in mainstream and tribal media accounts; to analyze and critique mainstream and tribal media accounts for accuracy and bias; and finally gain intercultural knowledge and competence through a final project that explores the intersection of Native environmental issues and the media.",

We will learn basic legal vocabulary terms in order to facilitate lively debate and understanding of the material. The course relies on the case method - reading actual judicial opinions to derive the legal \u2018rule' that governs various media law disputes - in order to allow students to obtain the most realistic picture of the law obtainable by non-lawyers. Students will engage in written and oral argument using major U.S. Supreme Court cases to more fully understand the difficult job appellate judges have in making sound precedent for society that resonates beyond the facts of a particular case. We cover the basic areas of First Amendment law, such as prior restraint, libel, obscenity and time-place-manner restrictions. Students will also be exposed briefly to a concise overview of non-Media Law subjects taught for the purpose of demonstrating context. We then study the ethical ramifications of Media Law precedents ascertaining the positive (what the law is) and distinguishing it from the normative (what the law should be). Discussion and assignments will emphasize the practical implications and meaning of these cases and legal concepts for journalists working in the age of social media, changing news delivery systems and overt hostility to the press.",

    "ClassOverview": "The president of the United States is forced to resign. Evidence of genocide is unearthed. Tax money meant for the poor is pocketed by the people entrusted to help. In each case, investigative reporting has played an essential role, and over the years, it has proven to be one of the highest forms of journalism: shedding light on wrongdoing and exposing corruption at the highest levels. In this dynamic course grounded in real-time investigative reporting, students will expose a problem of significant national or international importance and chronicle its effects on the lives and livelihoods of those most impacted, particularly those in disenfranchised communities. Throughout the winter and spring quarters, students will take on one critical subject using the tools honed by investigative reporters: documents, data and sources. Students will dig deep and learn on the go, reporting on a complicated topic, synthesizing findings and writing or producing a compelling, long-form investigative story suitable for publication. In the past six months, students at the Medill Investigative Lab have published more than 15 stories in The Washington Post, focused on the impact of COVID-19 in America's nursing homes. The stories have prompted calls for investigations by members of Congress. The winter course is a primer: Working remotely, students will devote a tremendous amount of time digging for information and framing stories. In the spring, students will report out stories on the ground, traveling when necessary and if possible. This course is open to both undergraduate and graduate students; students will work as a team and with the professor to report, write and produce stories.

    "ClassOverview": "This course will explore the art of telling stories. In this class, we'll talk about finding story, about reporting and of course about writing, about how one goes about making sense of the tale at hand. Students will learn the kind of deep, intimate reporting required for magazine features, and will learn how to piece together a story so that it feels both literary and compelling. Students will work on a longer feature (with approval from the instructor you can pursue projects already underway), along with a couple of shorter writing assignments which we will workshop in class. We will also read some of the best nonfiction writing out there, and dissect those stories so we can come to understand how a writer builds a story, from conception to writing. It's my hope that by the end of the quarter, students will emerge as more accomplished storytellers and writers.",

What forms does it take? How does it manifest in everyday life?  How are people affected by the violence of war, and how are societies changed by political violence?  Central to such questions is the place of resistance and its relationship to violence. What are the different ways to resist violence?  What does it mean to struggle for self-determination? When does a freedom fighter become terrorist?  What forms of resistance might give hope for social change?  And should resistance be violent or non-violent?  Circulating through these questions is a fundamental concern with power.  Thus, this course will be concerned with power as a concept that animates violence and resistance.  We will explore these questions and delve into topics that include the study of war, genocide, gender violence, gang violence and decolonization in varying geographic areas.

The first objective of this course is to develop a critical understanding of the different disciplinary and methodological approaches to emotion and its place in political life. To that end, we will analyze how rationality and emotion are conceptualized and theorized in different disciplinary traditions, considering  the processes by which private, individual emotions become public, collective, and politically relevant?

The second half of the course is designed to discern patterns and identify concrete ways that specific emotions\u2014such as fear, shame, anger, and hope\u2014shape politics.",

STS scholars have examined how knowledge and artifacts are designed, developed, transferred, adopted, used, or rejected by knowledge workers, technically skilled people, invisible technicians, marketers, and all kinds of users. STS scholarship has shown how the development of science and technology are historically contingent and culturally situated, as well as can be gendered, racialized, hierarchical, ideologically influenced, and politically motivated. Despite these important findings, STS is currently still dominated by Euro-American theories, practices, languages, and institutions. But technoscience hasn't only been produced in North America and Europe. This course decenters the Euro-Atlantic world as the sites of scientific and technological production by introducing STS scholarship in and about Asia. It explores the question what can we learn about science and technology by studying them in Global Asia where most of humans of have been living.",

On the one hand, it has given news professionals an unprecedented capacity to engage in meaningful conversation with their audiences, which provides them with valuable insight to better understand the public, their preferences and their news consumption patterns. On the other hand, social media has enabled journalists to tell stories across a wider range of platforms, personalising their news offering, and reaching different demographics. Social Media has also come with challenges. Twitter, Facebook and news aggregators, such as Google and Apple News, are now users' preferred news providers, even if the content is produced in mainstream media organisations such as the NYT or the BBC. This trend has seen advertising revenue shifting from mainstream media to online outlets, and from legacy organisations to social media platforms.With these developments in mind, this practical course introduces students to the use of social media for news gathering, production and dissemination. Through engagement with social media platforms such as TikTok, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram, students will learn how to produce news, curate and verify information, engage with audiences and gain followers, do live reporting and social listening, and crowdsource investigations. Finally, this course will also train students to deal with toxic comments online and trolling.",

Matters of faith and its practices, contestations, pamphleteering, violence, social backlashes, and fictive storylines are all fodder for media content and for provoking crucial global conversations. In this class, students will be introduced to the surprisingly close relationships between the mighty forces of media and religion in what is arguably a \"secular\" age. We will take a close look at the evolution of religious content in popular media (including entertainment, journalism, and religious broadcasting) and examine how this all relates to what is loosely called \"globalization.\" We will also consider methods to produce case studies of major media stories that started as or evolved into religion-based narratives, mainly Islam, such as ISIS's use of digital media; reactions and counter-reactions to the Charlie Hedbo shootings; Western discourses appropriating religion for political advantage; and appraisals of media handling of such flashpoints as the Chapel Hill murders, South Carolina church shootings, post-elections intimidations, and more.

Modern sports were born in the early 19th century, at the same time and for the same reasons as modern mass media; the two have ever since been joined at the hip, such that scholars often refer to them as one institution: \"mediasport.\" Today sport is the most valuable, highest-earning media product in the global entertainment industry\u2014indeed for most of us, sport is something we consume, not something we do. And yet the \"right to play\" is\u2014according to the United Nations, the International Olympic Committee, and the European Union\u2014a fundamental human right. So it's big stuff\u2014less than war, but more than a game. In this course, sport is considered from various contexts. We do it through weekly monitoring of sports media, documentary films, student research and writing assignments, and class discussion. Our contexts include commerce and industry, domestic and international politics (including war) gender and sex identities, racial and ethnic relations, religion and spirituality, and popular culture from fashion to video games.",

Research has demonstrated the dual role of media in supporting change, acting as both force for renewal and conformity. The course will unpack media's role as a catalyst for change in societies going through transformational processes such as revolts, social movements, and transitions to democracy with a focus on the Global South. The lectures and seminars will explore the following questions: How media relate to social and political structures? What is the role of public media and the notion of the public good? How do alternative media contribute to challenging dominant media and political discourses and cultures? What is the relationship between media, journalistic practices, and activism? Can we talk about media for development? The course will cover Issues of race, poverty, gender, inequalities, and the climate crisis. Course will explore notions such as voice, resilience, digital media and alternative practices/cultures, pluralism, agnostic media, antagonism, and negative polarization, among other important contemporary discussions. The course will use lectures, seminars and guest talks and will take case studies from international media and politics with focus on the Global South.",

We will answer questions like: What can search results tell us about power? How is Twitter a racial artifact? Why do user-generated videos of an event change the way it is understood. Digital media texts require approaches which recognize changes in practices of reading, analysis, and interpretation. At the same time, they are connected to historical forms like the bulletin board, the satellite image, and political cartoons in newspapers. This course therefore takes both a historical and semiotic approach to the study of digital media to situate the objects that we engage with daily\u2014hashtags, selfies, search results, image filters, and memes\u2014along a longer history of media forms. In doing so,  it grapples with questions of epistemology\u2014how we know what we know\u2014prompted by global changes. By approaching digital artifacts in these ways, it shows how imaginaries of what they are shape our understandings of visibility, sociality, and power.

Modern sports were born in the early 19th century, at the same time and for the same reasons as modern mass media; the two have ever since been joined at the hip, such that scholars often refer to them as one institution: \"media sport.\" Today sport is the most valuable, highest-earning media product in the global entertainment industry\u2014indeed for most of us, sport is something we consume, not something we do. And yet the \"right to play\" is\u2014according to the United Nations, the International Olympic Committee, and the European Union\u2014a fundamental human right. So it's big stuff\u2014less than war, but more than a game. In this course, sport is considered from various contexts. We do it through weekly monitoring of sports media, documentary films, student research and writing assignments, and class discussion. Our contexts include commerce and industry, domestic and international politics (including war) gender and sex identities, racial and ethnic relations, religion and spirituality, and popular culture from fashion to video games.",

We will take a close look at the evolution of religious content in popular media (including entertainment, journalism, and religious broadcasting) and examine how this all relates to what is loosely called \"globalization.\" We will also consider methods to produce case studies of major media stories that started as or evolved into religion-based narratives, mainly Islam, such as ISIS's use of digital media; reactions and counter-reactions to the Charlie Hedbo shootings; Western discourses appropriating religion for political advantage; and appraisals of media handling of such flashpoints as the Chapel Hill murders, South Carolina church shootings, post-elections intimidations, and more.

Such questions may seem philosophical, but their answers pertain directly to our (ever-changing) experience of moving-image media, such as film, television, or web content. To better understand the persistent power and appeal of these media, this course will sample the range of questions and answers\u2014or theories\u2014of the moving image from the 1910s to today. The course will engage with often difficult texts to understand their arguments and their implications for our contemporary media landscape. Each week will focus on a theme and discuss no more than two essays. Assessments will be based on short posts and either several brief papers or one longer essay. By the end of the course, students will be able to 1) identify key theories and theorists of moving-image media; 2) describe the main arguments and ideas of any given essay; 3) apply those arguments or ideas to contemporary examples of either films, television programs, or trends.",

It starts with looking at the history of Zionism and the idea of establishing a Jewish homeland in Palestine; then moves to discuss the consequences of the implementation of this idea within colonial and postcolonial contexts. Particular importance is given to the 1948 war and the subsequent creation of Israel; where the region entered a state of conflict between Israel and the neighboring Arab countries that left devastating impacts. Top of these are the emergence of the Palestinian refugees issue, and the lack of Palestinian statehood. Following the chronology of the conflict with its war and peace episodes, the course intends to critically discuss the conflicting narratives, role of regional and international players and the long-lasting and present ramifications of the conflict that have affected the shape and politics of the Middle East.",

Pop culture, such as cinema, television, street art, music, and social media, has been a means of both resisting and shoring up authority, of affirming and subverting societal norms and taboos, enabling the production of new forms of community and publics, and of motivating and expressing political action. We will critically examine examples of pop culture from societies throughout the region, analyzing their connection to power structures and changes in ideology and nationalism, gender/class/religious identity and practice, comportment and urban space, and state power. This course will draw on research approaches in media studies and anthropology to theorize the role of popular culture in reflecting, challenging, and expanding political horizons in the region.",

Matters of faith and its practices, contestations, pamphleteering, violence, social backlashes, and fictive storylines are all fodder for media content and for provoking crucial global conversations. In this class, students will be introduced to the surprisingly close relationships between the mighty forces of media and religion in what is arguably a \"secular\" age. We will take a close look at the evolution of religious content in popular media (including entertainment, journalism, and religious broadcasting) and examine how this all relates to what is loosely called \"globalization.\" We will also consider methods to produce case studies of major media stories that started as or evolved into religion-based narratives, mainly Islam, such as ISIS's use of digital media; reactions and counter-reactions to the Charlie Hedbo shootings; Western discourses appropriating religion for political advantage; and appraisals of media handling of such flashpoints as the Chapel Hill murders, South Carolina church shootings, post-elections intimidations, and more.

    "ClassOverview": "\"Play\" is often directly contrasted with \"work,\" and is often seen as childish, frivolous, and fanciful. However, play is an important context in which children, and adults, learn and communicate, and is a topic of rigorous academic study across disciplines. This seminar brings together two threads of study related to the art and science of play.  In the first half of the course, they are traced in parallel.  The first thread, the art of play, focuses on the history and development of Viola Spolin's foundational and ubiquitous theatre games, and their surprising grounding in the early academic studies of play by Neva Boyd, NU Faculty from 1927-1941, who was an early proponent of the importance of play and its academic study, and Spolin's mentor.  The second thread, the science of play, is a look at the child's ontological development of play skills, informed by Piagetian and modern insights, with a focus on how play drives communication development.  In the second half of the course, we bring the two threads together, as students collaboratively engage in and reflect on the art and science of Spolin's games. For example, students learn and play the Mirror game, exploring it within the context of the study of acting and performance, as well as how it depends on the brain's mirror neuron system and how parents of Autistic children are taught to match turns with their child's communication.",

The material will pull from a range of contemporary modern techniques including Counter Technique, European floor work and release styles, Flying Low, and Bartenieff Fundamentals. All of which include, spiraling, inverting, effortless traveling, and the overall practice of less effort for efficient functional movement.Each class will begin with a guided follow-along structure, to stretch, ground into the floor, and warm our bodies. Occasionally we will do this through improvisation sessions and/or across the floor phrasing. This concentrated time at the beginning of class will develop our somatic awareness of our body in space and wake up the various pathways in the body. The remainder of the class will be spent refining these ideas through short or long movement phrases. We will spend at least a week to two weeks on each of these phrases to allow the body time to fully integrate and somatically comprehend the spatial pathways. As a facilitator, I am invested in cultivating a space of open conversation about somatic sensory experiences, as well as a space of experimenting with pathways that are effective to your unique anatomy. Cultivating a space that is creative, holistic, and connective.",

Longer movement passages fusing technique with a range of stylized movement addressing turns, floor work, extensions and jumps complete the class.The emphasis is on focus; specifically bringing the focus to transitions, and the idea that all mo(ve)ments are transitional. Transitions micro and macro, we use the micro lens of the focus on the local/personal movement/moment to affect not only the larger technical concept being addressed, but the global/spatial movement patterns and the performative aspect as well.  We will address the idea of performing without grafting on any additional frameworks outside of spatial concepts, letting the clarity and truth of the movement concept project itself, finding the humanity in abstraction.  Using total commitment to presence in the fully embodied execution of the moment at hand by integrating the ideas of total presence in repetition of learned material, and use of improvisation in technical exercises to infuse the material with vital energy and urgency, and aid in keeping the focus on the now.",

We will study some of the innovative management methods that have emerged in these areas over the past two decades and develop an understanding of how these mediums effect logistical/aesthetic direction, personnel communications, and product release processes.

We will also examine the social and imaginative worlds constructed by African artists themselves, alongside the embodied, creative work they create to capture multifaceted realities of what it means to be African today. As a community of learners, we will collectively engage the possibilities and limits of several performance strategies (i.e., reenactment, play, and revision) in approaching a diverse continent with a lively global image.

    "ClassOverview": "This course will introduce students to a poorly understood art form that has been reborn many times, including today, in the light of pandemic restrictions on theatrical production: audio drama. In the 20th century, radio plays were among the most popular forms of fiction in many parts of the world. Legends have come down about thrillers of the 1930s, but these remain framed inside narratives of nostalgia, and are not representative of the broad work of experimental writers in the medium. In this class, you will learn how radio dramas were made in three historical periods: classic American (1937-54); mid-century British (1954-1974) and contemporary podcast traditions, with additional focus on audio dramas in the global south, including Cuba, South Africa and India. We will explore the cultural and political background of each of these contexts, practice how to \"read\" a radio play, and ask about how the form interacts with various media, and expressive agendas. In 2023, this class will work will experiment with a new collaboration, working with studends from Linda Gates's class on voice acting, and we will collaborate on a small production.",

    "ClassOverview": "Since its inception, Israeli society is comprised of various and different social groups; immigrants, Arabs, Jews, foreign workers, religious people, secular people, ultra-orthodox Jews, Christians, to name several. In a society where many feel themselves as outsiders, what does Otherness actually mean? Is it a subjective stance or a definite (and \"objective\") position? Does Otherness exist only when juxtaposed with what is supposedly the social norms of \"Israeli society\" or can it stand by itself? Does Israeli society is othering others to have a false sense of unity? And is there an actual entity of \"Israeli society\" or is it only imagined by those who seek to be part of it? Film in its nature is an introspective tool, and in the case of Israeli film it has always been a prism through which Israeli directors examine questions of identity, the treatment of \"others\", and the relationship between the center and the margins. In this class we will watch various Israeli films that relate to the notion of otherness and to the dilemmas that arise from the characters' complex position in Israeli society. Among the movies we will watch are \"Noodle\", \"Borrowed Identity\", \"Sandstorm\" and \"Baba Joon\". We will read texts that will contextualize the movies and will shed light on the stance of otherness in Israeli society. No previous knowledge of Hebrew or Israel or Israeli cinema is required. All the movies will have English subtitles and all the readings will be in English, as well as the lectures and class discussions.",

In this production-focused course, students will transform the routine of \"rummaging\" into inspiration and material for their own creative work.Adhering to a weekly practice of mining thrift stores, second-hand shops, garage sales, and garbage cans for materials, objects, spaces, and encounters, students will develop their own artistic relationship to object creation, character development, and \"world-building\". Moving through 4 units - Salvage, Thrift, Reuse, Transform - students will blend this mode of artistic production with conceptually driven performances to create experimental video work. In addition to this studio component, students will study a wide array of artists whose performative and video practices utilize \"low-budget\" materials, and basic modes of production, epitomizing the resourcefulness of queer art making.",

All these qualities offer a vast set of expressive opportunities that can contribute to constructive social change.This production class will include tutorials about QR codes, Virtual Reality (360 filming and editing for VR, WebVR, HTC Vive and Unity), media art installations. In addition to these tools, participants can use any existing low or high technology such as USPS mail system, email, augmented reality apps, SMS, tattoo and t-shirt design, Morse code, Skype, Google image search, sound recordings, Siri, film and video, photographs, music, flash mobs, etc. Class participants will design a short virtual, alternate, or fragmented reality experience that purposefully blurs reality and fiction and narrates a story.Participants may choose to collaborate for their Final Project. No coding skills are needed.Registration Requirements: junior sophomore senior and graduate students can take this course. RTVF students have the prerequisite of RTVF 190. No prerequisite is required for non-RTVF students.",

And what are the ongoing tensions and fault lines around identity and desire that remain unaddressed through queer theory's political interventions?

    "ClassOverview": "With daily reports of super storms, heat records, species declines, and melting arctic ice, there is a global recognition that we are living in an era of environmental crisis. What role does the media play in that crisis? Media production depends upon the expenditure of large amounts of energy and natural resources. Media devices contain toxic materials and take part in a culture of obsolescence that sends increasing amounts of \"high tech trash\" to the landfill. Media content has often developed in close connection to advertising, and so has taken part in the creation of an unsustainable consumer culture. Despite marketing rhetoric that characterizes digital technologies as weightless, virtual, and environmentally clean, there are vast energy, resource, and labor costs that undergird the Internet. At the same time, media communication can function to increase awareness about environmental issues, can substitute for other kinds of high-carbon activities like international travel, can foster understanding of the more-than-human world, and can aid in the fight for environmental justice, as well as a host of other social and cultural benefits. How can we make sense of the complicated equation of environmental cost and benefit in media culture?This course will explore intersections of media and environment, considering media about the environment, media in the environment, and media as environment. It will cover a variety of media forms and examine how they shape our perception of the environment and foster environmental action. We will consider topics such as theories of media ecology; definitions of the \"Anthropocene\" epoch; the materiality of media infrastructure; media's role in raising environmental consciousness and promoting environmental justice; advertising and consumer culture; wildlife documentary; ecocritical aesthetics; environmental history; indigenous media; representations of landscape and soundscape; and animals as media performers. We will assess multiple forms of media (film, television, videogames, podcasting, sound art, infographics, and more) from a range of critical frameworks. We will consider numerous genres of environmental media as well, including apocalyptic eco-disaster narratives, eco-comedies, \"toxic\" dramas, environmental melodrama, conspiracy thrillers, documentary, and animation.",

Modeled after the pre-production phase for professionally produced documentaries, the course will guide students in developing a written proposal, a verbal pitch, and a pitch deck. Students will generate ideas, delve into research, and explore various methods of approach while learning about funding, thinking about their audience, and considering their potential impact.If you are unsure what to focus on, this class will allow you to investigate ideas and do preliminary research. If you already have a firm concept, fantastic! However, don't be afraid to switch gears. Sometimes students have great ideas but realize they can't get the necessary access or discover logistical roadblocks. Although a year sounds like a long time, it is essential to conceptualize a doable project within our limited time. The pressure of creating a thesis can freeze some students up, and for many people, it's impossible to be creative when they can't relax. So, while the learning objective is to clarify and shape your thesis, it is equally about understanding your creative process and embracing it.",

We will look at assumptions about what a series is, discuss episodic and serial forms of television storytelling, and look at the ways in which new media technologies may inflect the ways in which people understand the medium and what it does. In addition, we will consider key terms and concepts in television (liveness, flow, intimacy, etc.) which have variously been considered key aspects of the medium's ontology, specificity, ideology, and/or textuality. In this context, students will have the opportunity to engage with specific television forms/texts, and the terminologies scholars have used to account for variations, permutations, and developments in television's narrative modes.All readings will be available through Canvas.",

In the 20th century, radio plays were among the most popular forms of fiction in many parts of the world. Legends have come down about thrillers of the 1930s, but these remain framed inside narratives of nostalgia, and are not representative of the broad work of experimental writers in the medium. In this class, you will learn how radio dramas were made in three historical periods: classic American (1937-54); mid-century British (1954-1974) and contemporary podcast traditions, with additional focus on audio dramas in the global south, including Cuba, South Africa and India. We will explore the cultural and political background of each of these contexts, practice how to \"read\" a radio play, and ask about how the form interacts with various media, and expressive agendas. In 2023, this class will work will experiment with a new collaboration, working with studends from Linda Gates's class on voice acting, and we will collaborate on a small production.",

    "ClassOverview": "Musical theatre history is not dusty and done. It lives on, and we are a part of it today. And that comes with a responsibility to know what it is that we as artists are reviving, sustaining, reinventing. History is always in the process of being made, and one way it is made is in its telling. How should the history of musicals be told? We will be investigating that question all quarter. Through readings, performance analysis, and discussions, in this class students gain an expanded toolkit and base of knowledge for thinking critically about musical theatre as it has changed over time. (This year the class includes an optional musical theatre writing component that interested students may elect to complete in lieu of selected course assignments; you may writing/compose\u2014individually or as part of a writing team\u2014original songs related to the historical periods we are studying at key junctures throughout the quarter.)",

Staging, or the arrangement and movement of performers on camera, is the key area of collaboration between directors, actors and cinematographers and perhaps is the most essential element of visual design in cinema (necessary even before lighting and editing can do their expressive work). This course will develop basic skills in designing dramatic and dynamic relationships between performers and camera through hands-on exercises in class and shooting in the field. We will introduce and practice different styles of coverage and editing as well as camera technique (dolly vs. handheld vs. tripod). This class develops skills necessary for actors, directors, cinematographers, but is also highly recommended for students focused on editing and soundrecording.",

The exploration will use the first field guide for flowers published in America as a launch point. HOW TO KNOW THE WILD FLOWERS by Mrs. William Starr Dana (Frances Theodora Parsons) was published three years after her husband died in the Russian Flu pandemic or 1890. Its poetic passages invite every person to find their way forward through whatever haunts and grieves them. In addition to this text, poetry, recipes, and Indigenous stories and perspectives on the land will fuel the devising process. To know the natural world - to identify its gifts and share them - is perhaps the best way to preserve it.  How do we bring this task into the theater? Students will craft their own pieces inspired by text and movement, some of which may be included in the larger project as it develops.",

Students in this advanced writing class will workshop a complete draft of a play that is approximately 60 pages in length (the page limit will be expanded if the play is chosen for additional workshopping in the spring quarter). The full draft will be read out loud in class and MFA and advanced undergraduate directing students will workshop and present scenes from the play. Students will serve as actors during the reading and workshopping of the play. Playwriting students will be expected to workshop a recent work. An older project may be workshopped if it has undergone significant revisions. This is the first part of a two part class. The second part is a production class which will run in the spring (likely Thursdays 11am-150pm). Four plays from part one of the class will be selected to receive workshop productions in part two. This will culminate in a weekend festival in June where the produced plays will be showcased.",

Over the quarter we will investigate how we can bring a greater sense of innovation and risk taking to our rehearsal process and experiment with new types of rehearsal methodologies. Students will learn Shana Cooper's original rehearsal methodology called Essence Work, a technique which aids theater makers in being responsive to the individual needs of a project. Essence work also enables all artists to contribute more deeply to the creative process, and to take greater ownership over the production.In addition to a close investigation of Essence Work, students will study the artistic processes and techniques employed by innovative artists like choreographers Twyla Tharp and Pina Bausch. This course is an opportunity to expand your understanding of and experience with non-traditional rehearsal methods and techniques.  It will help you to break open your habits of creation and storytelling, and develop the tools to innovate your artistic process and the work generated by that practice. Both directors and actors will physically participate during in-class explorations.",

    "ClassOverview": "Learning is not neutral; it is not the acquisition of an autonomous set of knowledge and skills. Learning happens in social and cultural practices, be they practices affiliated with cultural communities, academic disciplines, or professional and interest-based domains. Many of these practices are also taking place in online, global and intercultural contexts where people bring diverse experiences to the process of cultural production and learning.This course provides a critical introduction to the social and cultural dimensions of learning, with a particular focus on how language and diverse tools and modes of expression mediate forms of identity, learning experiences, and participation in and transformation of social life. We will engage with ways of conceptualizing and studying the relation of culture, language and identity, interrogate existing borders, binaries and hierarchies, and consider learning in the contexts of demographic diversity, transnational migration, media flows and youth cultures.An important goal of this course is to explore how linguistic and cultural diversity can provide generative resources for learning and education. Traditional schools and classrooms tend to draw from a limited range of resources for learning. This is reflected in the literature and content that are used, and the expectations for how people interact and communicate with each other. Such restricted curriculum contributes to the fact that many students' experiences are being marginalized from schooling, and students' having difficulty identifying with what they are expected to learn (cf. Martinez, Morales & Aldana, 2017). In this class, we will read studies that tackle these issues, which are both social scientific and political issues. We will also consider new ways to think about and design learning environments that draw from and build on a diverse range of knowledge, language and cultural resources for learning - resources that are more reflective of the experiences of our students.Through the class readings, materials and discussions, we will venture into diverse settings across community, school, and new media environments. We will discuss research studies and promising educational designs to reconsider notions of culture and identity, agency and power, and societal engagement and education of our multicultural youth population.",

All of thesearrangements have been \u2018designed', either explicitly with intention or moreunintentionally, evolving over time. We will call these everyday organizations; they allowus to solve problems, achieve our goals, and generally get things done. Except when theydon't. In this class, you'll learn to identify and analyze everyday organizations throughfieldwork, document what's working and what's not, and learn about creative ways toredesign them.The analysis of existing everyday organizations will draw on theoretical perspectives thatgo by names such as distributed cognition and actor network theory. These perspectivesprovide us language for talking about and analyzing everyday organizationsthat are composed of both humans and \"non-humans\" (i.e., objects, tools, spaces,technologies, and representations). In this literature, a near synonym for what we calleveryday organizations is \"socio-technical systems\". The argument of these theoreticalperspectives is that we must recognize the inextricability of the \"socio\" and the\"technical\" parts of these systems, how they (humans and non-humans) work together (ordon't) to do what they do.Another important aspect of the class is looking critically and creatively at the values thatinform existing designs of everyday organizations and the values that are guiding yourredesigns of these systems.  In existing everyday organizations, these values are oftenimplicit, multiple, and even contradictory, but they are important to consider.Overall, the course readings are varied and interdisciplinary; they include literature fromcognitive science, sociology, anthropology, design, and the learning sciences.

In this course, we will explore views of learning that can be used to realizethe promises and avoid the pitfalls that technological innovations can hold for learning in both informaland formal settings.This course is based on the premise that exploring learning with technology will allow us to deepenour understanding of how to effectively teach with technology. As educators, researchers anddesigners, we need our understandings of technology and its uses to be connected to the theories oflearning that are enacted in our practice whether we make them explicit or not. To this end, we willexamine how combinations of cognitive, sociocultural and ecological theories enable us to articulateunderstandings of learning that will improve our pedagogical practice. We will explore the design ofactivities using technologies that encourage teachers to recognize and value the multiple pathwaysthat learners travel to make sense of new ideas. These designs also provide opportunities for multipleavenues of research related to learning and teaching.The course is designed to immerse students in the use of technological tools for learning and thedesign of projects for learning with various technologies. Projects, readings and writing in variousgenres are intended to help students to reflect on their own learning and the learning of others.Course work is also designed to provide opportunities to try out, analyze and interpret variousapproaches to teaching with technologies. The goal is to develop perspectives on learning andteaching with technology that enable both pre-service teachers and emerging learning scientists tocreate learning environments that support learners in coming to understand academic ideas,themselves, and their social/cultural contexts.For example, we will look beyond the popular assumption that coding is a good skill for all children aspreparation for future economic expansion and workforce development. We will give greater attentionto deeper meanings and purposes of coding. We will consider what computational thinking can bewhen educators attend to the new ways learners can make sense of ideas and phenomena usingcomputational tools. The kinds of questions that emerge from the work in this class include: How cangeometry be explored and understood differently with computational tools as opposed to traditionalpedagogical approaches? How can engaging in inquiry using sensing devices help learners toexpand their sense of possibility for what they can make, learn and do? How does the cultural contextof learning inform how technology can be taken up to support learning? What new purposes andmeanings for technology use might young people generate for themselves?",

What counts as fact vs. opinion vs. belief and so on; who gets to decide and under what conditions? How is knowledge produced and how does it gain traction?  How does the source and type of knowledge interact with socio-political-cultural constructs and systems of power and, in turn, how can \"knowledge\" be used to produce and/or perpetuate power and privilege or to empower those who are marginalized? Finally, how does what we do in SESP and at Northwestern as both consumers and producers of knowledge fit within the landscape of these questions?In this course students will explore these and other questions to gain insight into the social production, distribution, consumption, interpretation, and operationalization of \"knowledge.\" Using primarily seminar-style discussion, the first portion of the course focuses on building and analyzing theoretical frameworks and applied texts in order to generate a working understanding of \"knowledge\" in its myriad forms.  Among our goals for the first portion of the course is to tie theoretical,  academic, and \"folk\" knowledges to everyday experiences and the world around us writ large.  The second portion of the class will involve a series of applied of cases studies, including welcoming members of the SESP faculty community to present on their research, which we will work to bring into conversation with our generated frameworks regarding the sources, types, and implications of knowledge.",

Our review of human development will center on the scientific literature that has led to the knowledge we have today. This course will stimulate a critical analysis of this literature to identify strengths, gaps, and important next steps for future research. We will review how to read, understand, and critically evaluate academic articles.

We also explore collective Holocaust memory and the development of mainstream framings of Holocaust history. We consider Jewish, Roma, and other victim narratives, including national memorialization, rituals of commemoration, and the development of Holocaust memorials, museums, and institutions in the United States and around the world. And we study how we have come to remember the Nazi perpetrators and their collaborators. We draw on course texts, including film and fiction, to ask questions about the relationships between individual and collective memories, as well as between commemoration and education.",

    "ClassOverview": "Together, we will explore the complex relationship between the emergence, existence, and (often) endurance of pressing social problems (e.g. inequality, discrimination, illness, hunger, poverty, violence) and the creation and implementation of policies meant to address them. Policy can define much of social life. It can determine who receives access to resources and services and who does not; what types of behavior are restricted and punished, and what types are rewarded; and how individual needs are balanced with a (far from consensus-) understanding of the collective, common good. Social policy, in other words, exists in a contested space, and one that shapes opportunities, resource structures, and life outcomes for individuals and communities. In the first part of the course, we will explore the political process by which these important policies are made. We will interrogate why some social problems receive more policy attention than others, how and by whom policy agendas are set, whose voices are listened to, and under what conditions meaningful policy change and transformation occurs. In the second part of the course, we will focus on policy implementation, exploring how policy moves through the regulatory system and is eventually carried out by front-line workers (e.g. teachers, social workers, police officers) who interface with the public. We will investigate how these interactions impact individuals and communities, ultimately shaping what the consequences of policy look like on the ground. Throughout the quarter, students will learn how to frame, write, and present a policy brief on an important social issue. We are excited to learn with you this quarter and to create an engaged, compassionate space for thinking about the most pressing social issues around us today.",

    "ClassOverview": "Human Trafficking, sometimes know as \"Modern Slavery,\" a global problem that ensnares millions ofmen, women, and children each year. Some estimates indicate that despite laws declaring traffickingillegal, the illicit practice currently victimizes more individuals than the height of the African SlaveTrade. While policy to enhance anti-trafficking efforts and to improve victim protections hasrapidly been approved, there are still questions about successful implementation of those policiesand important questions about elite influence in the development of equitable policies. From apolicy perspective, human trafficking is difficult to address because the entire practice is illicit, andas a result, hidden. Further, trafficking often victimizes individuals who are already vulnerabledue to poverty, immigration status, youth, domestic abuse, and/or drug abuse, which means anti-trafficking policy often overlaps with many other policy spheres including immigration, security,environmental policy, sex industry policies, and health policy.This class gives an overview of the development of the African slavery in the United States, as awindow into slavery generally and what has and has not changed. In particular, we consider howhuman trafficking could rise following the legal emancipation of slaves in the 19th century. We willfollow the development of modern anti-trafficking policy as it arose from distinct policy areas forsex (the Mann Act) and labor (peonage and indentured law statues) and how these distinctionsboth inform and limit current policy efforts. We will also investigate the difficult of addressingtrafficking, both from a governmental and non-governmental perspective. We will also considerhow trafficking varies globally, particularly how differences in policy definitions and institutionalstructures matter for successful prosecution of trafficking. The class will also discuss the roles ofthe public and the media in development and limitations of anti-trafficking policy. We will talkabout the difficulties in both defining the extent of human trafficking and assessments of currentpolicy. Finally, we will consider how the case of trafficking within the United States fits within aglobal endemic, and how national efforts matter to international work.",

    "ClassOverview": "Thanks to the 1980s and 90s, Black women writers have become well known in popular US culture. Specifically, Toni Morrison's historical Nobel Prize in Literature (1993), the adaptations of novels by Alice Walker, Toni Cade Bambara, and Zora Neale Hurston into film, and the advent of Oprah Winfrey's book club mark moments where Black women's fiction moved out of the margins of popular reading culture. Moreover, while these works became best known at the end of the twentieth century, there is a much longer literary history attributed to Black women writing very layered, intriguing, and beautifully-written fiction, both short and long.In January 2020, Time said this of Zora Neale Hurston's short fiction, most of which was written in the 1940s: \"Hurston's short fiction is ripe with imagery and narratives that blend the real and the idyllic, the whimsical and the serious, the natural and the cultural.\" Known best for her novel, Their Eyes Were Watching God, Hurston also produced several short stories. This course will explore the long tradition of Black women's fiction, beginning in the nineteenth century and ending in the present moment, primarily through the short story genre.In this class, we will survey a wide range of Anglophone Black Diaspora women authors and primarily concentrate on those from the US. We will interrogate themes, symbols, and forms in short fiction works that extend across the Black Femme/Feminine Literary tradition. We will ask how these authors similarly and differently explore Black feminine identity as it intersects at the juncture of unique social, economic, and sexual contexts. What are the unique issues of Black womanhood that they explore? Of what do they attend, outside of Black womanhood? Our authors will include at least Alice Dunbar-Nelson, Zora Neale Hurston, Toni Morrison, Octavia Butler, and Edwidge Danticat. Assignments will include, at least: regular online discussions, in-class discussion leading, and an individual final project.Students will be evaluated on their performance in these assignments as well as class attendance and participation. This seminar depends on discussion and participation of every member of the class. Come to class ready to enthusiastically address issues of race, gender, class, and sexuality.",

This course will explore black theater and theatre making from the mid-nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century. As a class we will excavate how the stage (and performance more broadly) have provided avenues of both radical and quotidian expression for black American subjects during this time period. From the early dramas of abolitionists to the revolutionary theater makers of the early 20th century, black theatre has always provided a critical ground to challenge the terms of personhood, subjecthood and citizenship for black people in the US. In this course we will combine critical theory with historical analysis, literary close reading, and archival studies to attempt to define, explore, and understand the critical work of black theater making. The objectives of the course are to give an introduction to the strategies and breadth of African American theatre and performance. The syllabus is designed for an advanced undergraduate major, with preference for enrollment given to theatre majors, juniors and seniors, although all students are welcome to enroll.",

    "ClassOverview": "Presidential elections are hard fought and can be controversial. In the 2016 election polls showed Hillary Clinton would win yet Donald Trump emerged victorious in the Electoral College while losing the popular vote. In 2000 George W. Bush also lost the popular vote but he was ultimately chosen the victor. The fallout from the recount and the Supreme Court decision that gave Bush the victory is still being debated and studied. In 2008 America elected its first African American President, Barack Obama and reelected him in 2012.This class will examine presidential elections and how they have evolved since 1952 the first year TV advertising began to have an impact on the races. This class will challenge some of the myths about elections and their outcomes. We will also examine the 2008 campaign, which was dubbed the \"YouTube\" election and was historic by virtue of its outcome, the candidates who ran and the impact the Internet and new technologies had on the race. In 2012 the Obama campaign had the most intense \"ground game\" of any campaign in history, we will examine how the campaign succeeded in this effort. In 2016 Donald Trump bypassed typical advertising methods of reaching voters by unleashing a torrent of Twitter messages, and finding a willing press that was, at least in the primaries, willing to give him uncritical or challenging coverage.",

    "ClassOverview": "The growth of the Latino population has transformed the U.S. and has led to heightened debates about their political power, cultural influence, citizenship, civil rights, and ethnic and racial categorization.  Yet as the 2020 election demonstrated, many Americans still don't understand who Latinos are or who Latinos have been and will become.  Latino communities have played a pivotal role in U.S. history for centuries.  In this course, students will explore the 500 year history of Latinos in the U.S. and across the Americas.  In its broadest sense, Latino History offers a reinterpretation of the U.S. history that focuses on race, migration labor, and empire.  It is also the history of a community that represents a growing percentage of the U.S. population as a whole and one that will increasingly influence the politics, social life, culture and economy of the U.S.  The course will also examine the movement of Latino peoples within and between the U.S., Latin America and the Caribbean using a variety of media including literature, film, and music as well as more traditional historical interpretations.  Students will gain a deeper understanding of the issues and histories that bring Latinos together, those that continue to divide them, their multiple and shifting racial classification, and the long struggles for equality and belonging that have animated their histories.",

Here's how you get Capone. He pulls a knife, you pull a gun. He puts one of yours in the hospital, you put one of his in the morgue. That's the Chicago way.\" In this class, we will examine \"the Chicago way\" from many different angles in order to interrogate the values with which various artists have endowed Chicago. We will read in a broad range of media: journalism, poetry, song, fiction, film, and sequential art to see how a sense of Chicago as a place works over time. We will pay close attention to depictions of the construction of American identity, and to the role of the artist and intellectual in the city.",

    "ClassOverview": "In an age of unprecedented global distress, what is the role of media in shaping discourses, representations, and experiences of mental illness? Western psychiatric frameworks are increasingly defining mental health/illness around the world via multilateral health organizations that intervene across cultural contexts to treat mental distress, and are also circulated via Western media narratives that shape the meanings people associate with mental health and illness.  What other narratives of mental health might be told?  What experiences of distress and resilience are obscured by these dominant frameworks?In this course, students will learn about the ways in which cultural meanings and social structures shape mental distress and how it is expressed and experienced by people across time and context.  We will critically examine dominant U.S. models of mental health and illness, and trace the global spread of these models. We will ask what underlying cultural assumptions and expectations about self, personhood, emotion, mind, body, well-being and success are embedded in these narratives and explore how representations in film and television serve to reflect, reinforce, or re-imagine such assumptions.  Through a combination of engagement with scholarship on culture and mental health, media studies, and our own critical analyses of media objects from film and television, we will explore these questions and work to generate creative and collaborative ideas about how to rewrite media narratives in order to better reflect the broad spectrum of experience.",

    "ClassOverview": "Overview: The first objective of this course is to introduce students to the many ways that babies and young children are fed around the world, including breastfeeding, bottle feeding, and complementary (non-milk) foods. We will discuss the health and social consequences of each mode of infant and young child feeding (IYCF), and what the international recommendations, i.e. best practices are. The second objective is to explore why there is such variety in infant feeding worldwide. These discussions will be guided by the socio-ecological framework, in which biological, socio-cultural, and psychosocial characteristics of the individual, household, community, and national policy are considered. Influences on infant feeding will be broadly considered. To do this, we will draw on literature in global health, ethnography, evolution, and public policy. We will also consider the representation of infant feeding in popular culture. The third objective of this course is to develop critical thinking and writing abilities. These will be developed through a series of short weekly writing assignments and an in-class presentation on a recent infant feeding news item.",

    "ClassOverview": "\"Economic anthropology refers to the anthropological study of political economy. The term political economy itself first appeared in in eighteenth century debates in industrial revolutionary England over the economic policies the state were to pursue. While classical economists such as Adam Smith formulated arguments for free trade in that particular context, they assumed that the hand of the state, whether to encourage free trade or to suppress it through colonial monopolies, was always in the game. By contrast, late nineteenth century neoclassical economists posited a pure, independent realm of the economy and economic behavior, which could be understood apart from politics and the modern nation-state. Most contemporary anthropologists of economic life retain the earlier, classical meaning of political economy, understanding economic facts and behavior to be embedded in larger socio-cultural contexts and firmly tie to politics, kinship and family, race and ethnicity, gender relations and colonial rule.This course provides an anthropological introduction to four organizing concepts in political economy, namely commodity, labor  money and property through close readings of foundational thinkers like Karl Marx, Rosa Luxemburg, Karl Polanyi, Adam Smith and their current interlocutors in anthropology and allied disciplines. The course tracks how the political life of economic phenomena and the economic contours of political life have been understood dynamically and in radically varying ways over time and space. The course attends in particular to the development of political economic thought and practice in the context of European colonialism's \"primitive accumulation,\" and to ongoing cross-pollination among Marxist, postcolonial, and anthropological critique in the study of \"the economy.\"\"",

In addition, different human groups or ethnicities vary markedly in the burden of these conditions, with factors like poverty, inequality and discrimination consistently predicting who is most affected. What might account for these common findings?  In this course we explore two related ideas to gain insights into these issues. The first is that many modern ailments may be viewed as an imbalance between modern life ways and those which shaped our biology during much of human evolution. The second is that differences in factors like inequality and discrimination, which trace to political, economic, and historical factors, help explain why some groups tend to be more affected by these conditions than others. We will begin by reviewing foundational concepts in evolutionary biology, molecular biology, anthropology and human evolution, revealing why our bodies by necessity come equipped with biology that is responsive and sensitive to the environments that we inhabit. We will then use these principles to explore domestic and global case studies that illustrate the power of evolutionary principles to shed light on why we get sick, including the role of social, economic and political factors as drivers of major disparities in disease burden.",

Each student will collect audio recorded data, transcribe it, and become familiar with data collected by course peers. We use the class corpus in discussion and in written analyses. Each week's readings explore a different analytic approach, and we link microsocial and macrosocial processes to investigate ways in which the seemingly mundane everyday particulars are both reflective of and constitutive of broader meaning.

Environmental anthropology became more prominent in the 1980s, and is typically characterized by research on communities' engagements with contemporary environmental issues. Environmental anthropology has greater commitments to advocacy, critique, and application than ecological anthropology, but as we'll see in this course, the proliferation of \"new ecologies\" (as opposed to \"new environmentalisms\") denotes the continued synergy between ecological and environmental anthropologies. This course is divided into two parts. Part I will provide an historical overview of the development of environmental anthropology. We will cover some of the most influential research trends in the field: environmental determinism, cultural ecology, systems ecology, ethnoecology, historical ecology, political ecology, and post-humanist ecology. Part II will then pivot to the application of environmental anthropology knowledge to some of the most pressing environmental issues facing the contemporary world: population pressure, capitalist consumption patterns, biodiversity conservation, sustainable agriculture, climate change, and environmental justice.",

    "ClassOverview": "\"When colonial empires invaded the Americas in the 16th century, Europeans marveled at the Indigenous cities distributed across the continent. This course examines the ancient cities of the Americas: their origins, their configurations, their operations, and their representations. It considers how archaeologists define urbanism among ancient societies, and why not every human settlement qualifies as a city.We will begin this course by studying the earliest experiments with settlement nucleation in the world. Then, we will review scholarship on ancient cities in North, Central, and South America. Topics will include urban configurations, everyday life in ancient cities, how inequality was built into urban space, and providing for city dwellers. We will discuss the characteristics of ancient Indigenous cities such as Cahokia in Illinois, Tenochtitlan in Mexico, Tikal in Guatemala, and Machu Pichu in Peru, among others. This class will provide you a general understanding of the ancient civilizations of the Americas through the characteristics of their major cities.\"",

Through readings and seminar-style discussions, we will trace the long history of conflicts between Indigenous peoples and the groups that have attempted to dominate, assimilate, and \"modernize\" them in the past five centuries. Through case studies, we will examine issues of race, ethnicity, and identity that have been crucial to these struggles. In this course we will focus on Indigenous agency, and how it is expressed through Indigenous resurgence, revitalization, resistance, and activism in Latin America. This course will highlight that, while Indigenous peoples in the Americas have endured marginalization, domination, and exploitation since the 16th century, being Indigenous in Latin America after Columbus is defined by a remarkable resilience against these forces.",

Does public art challenge or reinforce social hierarchies in urban spaces? This course examines how aesthetic expressions and practices such as urban design and architecture, public art and graffiti, and public performances shape struggles over rights to the city. For example, we will learn how indigenous migrants from Latin America paint murals to challenge anti-indigenous racism and erasure in Los Angeles and how urban developers in Delhi use aesthetic judgments of the working poor to justify their forced removal from public spaces. While aesthetics are commonly associated with the visual qualities of people and things, this course will explore multi-sensory aesthetic experiences and judgments, such as noise control initiatives in Tapei and the racial politics of smell in New York City. Students will have the opportunity to develop arts and media-based final projects that examine urban aesthetics through methods that include but are not limited to sound/smell maps, comics, podcast episodes, performances, or art installations. By the end of the course, students will be able to critically analyze the aesthetic politics of the urban built environment within and beyond dominant visual-centric approaches.",

Work will be done in a two-dimensional format using paint on a gesso-prepared ground on a canvas support. The focus is on acquiring the basic material and technical skills necessary to articulate visual ideas in paint, including how to organize compositions using color and value relationships, form and shape, placement and paint application. Although most exercises deal with problems in painting, considerable work in drawing may be required to support studies in the use of color and paint. Assignments may introduce students to a variety of subject matter, such as still life, landscape and the figure in representational and abstract form. Instruction is individualized and students and faculty participate in one-on-one discussions of works in progress. Students also participate in class discussions and critiques to develop the criteria for making their own judgments about works of visual art. Evaluation is based on the degree of growth, attendance, participation and the degree of mastery of painting materials and techniques.",

But Farocki understood Brecht and Godard and extended their work through films (documentary, essay, activist), installations and writings. He also understood contemporary Italian thinkers (Negri, Lazzarato, Virno) and their radical approach to labor, life, and creativity. In an incredibly large and varied body of work produced from the 1960s to the 2010s Farocki addressed two principal subjects: the practices of labor and the production of images. When we experience this work, multiple lines of flight open up. What is an image? How do images shape our subjectivities, our social and political systems?",

Students will be introduced to the techniques of relief printing, various types of monotype impression making and screen printing. Particular attention will be given to exploring the physical process of how visual and performance artists have historically incorporated the body as a tool in printmaking. This past year, the notion of repetition has seemed close to our active political lives. Repetition in the form of news cycles and viral multiplication have put pressure on our sense of safety and well-being, whereas repetition in the form of daily rituals and work-from-home routines have helped many of us to stabilize ourselves and maintain a sense of hope throughout this difficult period. This course will use the printmaking process as a space in which to meditate on and discuss these valences of repetition.Through precedents and techniques, we will consider themes surrounding political agency, pleasure, and body politics. Through substantive analysis of course readings; creative workshops; in-class presentations; guest lecturers; and guiding assignments students will develop the skills to make social engaged explorations in print-media and will consider how print-media can function as both a form of self-expression and a form of self-care in their own practices.",

One of the most popular and potent sites of cultural, social, and political contestation, \"Black portraiture\" has emerged as an expansive category of inquiry across the fields of art history and cultural studies. In this first-year seminar, students will engage a range of approaches to Black figural representation from the early twentieth century to the present. We will analyze how artists and ordinary subjects have used film, painting, photography, and sculpture to generate representations of themselves and others in order to address issues including but not limited to beauty, class, gender and sexuality, racism and antiblack violence, modernity, and decolonization. Students will learn how to interpret, discuss, and write about portrait-based objects in terms of their material form, circulation, reproduction, sites of display, and patronage.",

    "ClassOverview": "Around 1720 a new style of art and architecture emerged amidst the highest echelons of the Parisian aristocratic elite: the Rococo. Characterized by gilt interiors, ornamental curves, and pastel colors, the Rococo infiltrated all forms of art making, from architecture, to painting, sculpture, porcelain, and even fashion. The style was immediately ridiculed for being overtly feminine, frivolous, and excessively luxurious. Associated intimately with the doomed queen of France, Marie Antoinette, the Rococo is often cited as a direct cause of the French Revolution that would take France (and Europe) by storm in 1789.In this course we will study Rococo art, from its origins in the sixteenth century to its fall from popularity circa 1785. By unpacking both the Rococo's bad reputation and socio-political importance, we will explore how the style was both gendered and racialized. How did Rococo art challenge dominant heteronormative aesthetic practices? How did it establish and fetishize a culture of whiteness in direct opposition to a growing colonial plantation system across the Atlantic? Throughout the quarter we will cover a variety of art forms (painting, sculpture, the decorative arts, and architecture) through the lives of key female patrons\u2014including the infamous Marie Antoinette and lesser-known art historical \"influencers\" such as Madame de Pompadour and Madame du Barry. Focusing primarily in France, this course will also look at iterations of and reactions to the Rococo in Germany, Italy, and England.",

    "ClassOverview": "The nineteenth century was an age of revolutions\u2014not only in Europe but across the globe. As the Industrial Revolution rapidly reshaped the world's material and social relations, popular revolutions erupted to overthrow corrupt ruling classes and experiment with new forms of political and social organization. Some of these revolutions are well-known, such as the French Revolution (1789) and the Russian Revolution (1917); others deserve more attention, such as the Ottoman Constitutional Revolution (1908). At the same time, the nineteenth century witnessed the massive expansion of European imperialism in Asia, Africa, and the Americas, igniting numerous anti-colonial revolutions, including the Haitian Revolution (1791) and the Indian Rebellion (1857). These revolutions posed a direct challenge to \"modern\" Europe and its supposedly liberal values.Moving between these diverse political and cultural contexts, this course investigates art's role in representing revolutionary ideals and producing new kinds of political subjects in the nineteenth century. This course takes a global frame that centers capitalism, interimperial competition, race, and gender as the primary forces that drove revolutionary art-making throughout the world. Instead of a broad survey, this course closely analyzes individual artworks in a wide range of media, including painting, sculpture, drawing, prints, photography, and political cartoons.",

    "ClassOverview": "At key moments throughout the intertwined histories of art and science, the emergence of new technologies transformed the possibilities of perception, representation, and knowledge alike. The field of media archaeology seeks to reconstruct the social contexts, cultural impacts, and imaginary horizons of these moments by investigating obsolete media technologies like the X-ray or the hologram.Grounded in the Block Museum's exhibition, The Heart's Knowledge: Science and Empathy in the Art of Dario Robleto, the course positions Robleto's creative practice as an entry point into the field of media archaeology. Robleto's inquiries into the histories of medical visualization, sound recording, and 19th-century visual culture will dovetail with readings and course materials that showcase various critical and artistic approaches to scientific media. Combining lectures, discussions, and student presentations, each week will examine a different set of objects and topics, such as maps, magic lantern projectors, silent films, early computer animation, planetariums, and virtual reality. Through film viewings, archival/study room visits, and guest lectures, students will enjoy the opportunity to materially engage with analog media technologies, and to interface with artists and scholars practicing diverse forms of media archaeology.Course requirements include short written assignments, an in-class presentation, and a final paper (with option for creative component). Students will be asked to individually attend at least one exhibit, archive, or screening outside of class.",

We will examine art produced in the sixteenth century across the globe, both in relation to European developments as well as independent of them. Students interested in the seminar should have some prior knowledge of early modern art history and be ready to address questions such as the following: How far away from Michelangelo could an artist live and still be part of a tradition labeled Renaissance? What if a sixteenth-century artist residing in Peru or the Kongo never set foot in Europe and yet produced works that could be considered European? Whose Renaissance is art history speaking of when it uses the term?Active participation in seminar, including writing weekly responses to readings, will count for 40% of the course grade. The remaining 60% will be determined by a multi-part research paper project and an oral presentation of work in progress.

    "ClassOverview": "How do we make community through care and collaboration? When does collective action become art? Taking art's recent \"social turn\" as a starting point, this class will explore how public performance, community organizing, forms of communal care, and mutual aid constitute creative interventions. Put differently, this is a course about creative forms of relationality and relationality as a creative form. Together, we will examine projects at the intersection of artistic practice and political activism, ranging from Fluxus and Womanhouse, to the Black Arts Movement in Chicago, feminist video collectives in Mexico City, and radical pedagogies of teaching artists in Chicago public schools, to contemporary tactical media interventions and large-scale international exhibitions. We will seek to understand how the less visible relationships behind artworks, exhibitions, or community projects themselves might constitute creative practices, while taking seriously the artistic value of interventions that may not look like \"art.\" In doing so, we will collectively investigate art historical theories of social practice and relationality. Accessible readings from interdisciplinary scholars will address themes of artistic collaboration and community action in relation to race, gender, queerness, and indigeneity. Along with participation, evaluation will be based on a short paper, a presentation, and a final project in the form of either a research paper, creative project, or community intervention, designed in discussion with the instructor.

What are the cultural dimensions of Pan-Africanism's drive for self-determination, civil rights, and political emancipation? What forms and formats have been important vectors for the circulation of Pan-African idea(l)s? How might we differentiate Pan-Africanism from related concepts such as Afrocentrism, Afropolitanism, Black Internationalism, and Worldmaking? In this course, we will analyze histories of art and aesthetic practices from the early 20th century to the present that are informed by or give shape to Pan-Africanist thought, including state-sponsored cultural festivals, paradigmatic artist collectives and art movements, transnational institutions, forms of vernacular and popular culture, as well as individual artistic practices. Students will engage seminal museum exhibitions that have examined the intertwining of African and African diasporic politics and culture and will gain insight into the planning of a forthcoming survey exhibition on Pan-Africanism slated to open at the Art Institute of Chicago in December 2024.

    "ClassOverview": "Through artistic representations ranging from urban planning materials to video art, this seminar considers how space is produced and contested. Utilizing the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, we will focus on modern and contemporary art from the nineteenth century to today that present and represent political power through spatial dimensions to better understand the role of space in shaping social relations and realities. From French Impressionism's disclosing of class anxieties through urban development to 1960s photography documenting anti-war demonstrations in the streets, we will look at artistic responses to spatial antagonisms such as gentrification, protests, suburbanization, and colonialism. While most of our objects engage with the uses of and rights to the city, this course also thinks about other contested spaces like the body as a site of transgression and resistance. Each week will revolve around connected themes\u2014public space and belonging, protest and confrontation, imagination and utopias, for example\u2014rather than being chronologically or geographically structured. As the course is conducted at the Art Institute, students will have a unique opportunity to work directly with artworks in the museum's collections, to develop critical skills for visual analysis first-hand, to draw connections between visual culture and spatial theory, and to gain knowledge about museum practices more broadly. We will therefore also ask questions of the museum itself as an institution that both shapes and facilitates claims to space/place and history. This course demonstrates the connections between spatial production, world-building, and visual culture in order to assess the radical possibilities of contesting space.",

    "ClassOverview": "Empire Redux charts the rise of a native modernist vision that emerged in negotiation with, and in resistance to, European colonial imperatives of spatial, ethnographic, and material control of the late Mughal empire. At par with Iberian and the Ottoman empires, the Mughal empire had extended over much of Central and South Asia since its inception in the 16th century. However, South Asia's long 18th century was marked by the rapid decentralization of the late Mughal State, Iranian, and Afghan invasions, and its gradual colonial takeover by the British East India Company in a period seen as a crisis of the Mughal State. In this phase, marked by large-scale migration of artists and literati fleeing the capital Delhi to the regional provinces, only a fledgling group of artists remained who were positioned at the nexus of exchange of power and patronage from the Mughals to the British. The seminar analyzes a new set of politically operative works which sought to recover the spatial, embodied, and performative histories of Mughal rule in a normative colonial sphere. Through themes focusing on cartography, court painting, urbanism, portraiture, ethnography, and souvenirs, this seminar will formulate the preconditions of a paradigmatic \u2018spatial and material turn' in 18th century artistic practice that not only upended the Company's provincializing and racializing approaches, but also reformulated the Mughal as de rigueur, recalibrating the parameters of colonial taste and consumption in Anglo-Mughal society.",

How do the formal elements of the game experience shape the stories that they tell and the meanings that they convey? What historical contexts make those stories meaningful, and what is the significance of historical shifts in game form? In this class, we answer these questions through a study of the Japanese Role-Playing Game\u2014the JRPG. We approach the JRPG as a genre, under the premises that cultural genres represent the formal crystallization of a set of cultural meanings, that individual works express particular meanings through manipulation of the details of form, that the evolution of form reflects historical shifts in cultural meanings, and that interpretation of an individual work thus demands knowledge of genre conventions, careful attention to the nuances of form, and rich historical contextualization. To study this genre, we begin by building skills of formal description and analysis, with attention to how scholars in different disciplines have attempted to theorize various formal elements. We then situate this genre in its historical context\u2014the social and cultural crises facing Japan at the end of the 20th century\u2014and examine the evolution and permutation of the form as it has been adapted to different narrative concerns between the late 90s and the present day. Though our focus is on the JRPG, the skills and modes of thinking that we develop\u2014formal description and analysis, historical contextualization and interpretation, theoretical framing, critical evaluation\u2014form the basis of humanistic study at the college level.",

Seoul has also tantalized many talented urban planners and architects keenly invested in creating a whole new space and modern lifestyle out of the old city's rich history. This course will trace Seoul's modern metamorphosis since the early 20th century to examine how the city and its residents transformed themselves and co-evolved throughout the tumult of the 20th and 21st centuries. We will be reading and watching various cultural representations of Seoul in literature, film, and TV shows. Our approach will draw upon critical media studies to question and examine the relationship between humans, environment, and media infrastructure.",

To achieve this goal, we will analyze a variety of sources, including literature, films, and other media by authors and activists concerned with the lives and realities of Chinese women. We will be joined in this enterprise by guest speakers based in the USA, mainland China, and Taiwan who, in their roles as scholars and activists, will help us navigate questions like:What do Chinese women wish to liberate themselves from, how do they enact this and to what end? In what ways does the problem of gender complicate the ideological advent of modernity in China? How do different technologies of communication and exchange, from the literary journal to cinematic narratives to cyberspace, help and/or hinder activism aimed at fostering gender equality and diversity in China? What connections exist between feminists and gender, sexuality, the body, media, nationhood, and politics? What changes and breakages do we see in the paradigms of traditional Chinese culture and the evolving expectations of women under Confucianism, communism and capitalism in the late nineteenth, twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, especially in the contemporary situation of globalization?",

    "ClassOverview": "AY 22-23  What kind of stories do video games tell, and what do these stories tell us about the cultures that produced them? How does the uniquely interactive nature of games give shape to the stories that they tell and the meanings that they convey? Where does the experience of play fit into the stories through which a culture produces meaning? This course explores these questions in the context of Japanese cultural history from the 1990s to the present. Our aim is simple: to learn to interpret games. Our approach is to furnish the historical and conceptual contexts necessary to make interpretation possible. We focus on a series of dominant narrative paradigms and subcultural tropes\u2014apocalyptic fantasy, world-type, survival, etc.\u2014and ask how these are rendered in game form. While our focus is ultimately on games as a form of narrative, we aim also to understand how the active and interactive nature of the game medium shapes the meanings that these texts convey. In particular, we ask how video games think about history: what they say about the historical situation faced by Japan between the close of the 20th century and the dawn of the 21st, where they reflect traces of deeper history that persist in that moment or where they efface those traces to present an eternal present of play, whether they contain the possibility of imagining a future.",

We focus on how visual and literary media have been used to represent such technologies (robotics, cybernetics, and the Internet) as well as how these technologies have shaped Japanese culture in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. The notion of the \"cyber\" - its origins in cybernetics and ensuing proliferation of meanings - forms the conceptual core of the course. After considering early definitions of this term, we turn to how Japanese manga, animation, film, and cultural theory explore the ways in which cybernetic technologies, like cyborgs and cyberspace, have expanded our understanding of human subjectivity and agency, transformed social relations, and blurred boundaries between the human and the animal, the biological and the artificial, and the physical and non-physical.",

    "ClassOverview": "AY 22-23 This course offers the opportunity to investigate martial art culture in Japanese society in the centuries between the Tokugawa shogunate takeover in the sixteenth century until the aftermath of WWII. Students will learn how samurai military culture and the Japanese art of sword fighting (kenjutsu) evolved conceptually from a system of fighting to cut down an adversary to one aimed at personal spiritual growth and cultivation of the mind. Course readings include treatises, essays, and poetry (waka, haiku) by several expert Japanese swordsmen including feudal lords, samurai, Buddhist monks, and philosophers who highlight not just actual combat techniques, but also the inward aspects that can lead to psycho-spiritual realization.Grounded in Confucian virtues, Buddhist doctrine, and the Shinto worldview, these figures discuss martial arts not only as mere external techniques of death, but also as inner techniques of life. In this course students will read works in English translation by and about several authors including Yagyu Munenori (1571-1646), Soho Takuan (1573-1645), Miyamoto Musashi (1582-1645), Kaibara Ekiken (1630-1714), Yamamoto Tsenetomo (1659-1719), Daidoji Yuzan (1639-1730), Yamaoka Tesshu (1836-1888), Takahashi Deishu (1835-1903), Daisetsu Teitaro Suzuki (1870-1966), Morihei Ueshiba (1883-1969), Taisen Deshimaru (1914-1982), and Omori Sogen Roshi (1904-1994).Some of the probing questions we will address are: what instigated the separation between traditional martial systems (bujustu) and modern martial arts (budo)? Where do the spiritual and the physical intersect in martial arts? What is the relationship between Buddhist doctrine and violence in the art of the sword? What does it mean for Aikido to be promoted as an \"art of peace\"? What kind of values can modern martial arts instill in their practitioners?",

The range and nature of responses to Fanon's work since his time speaks to the continued problem of colonialism, anti-Blackness, and the racialized gender system, as well as the changes in paradigms and discourse surrounding these issues. The course encourages seminar participants to think critically with and about Fanon's work, to find ways to incorporate Fanon into their respective research agendas and explore the renewed significance of Fanon's work today.",

    "ClassOverview": "*INFORMATION IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE*The instructors of \"Lessons in Non-Profit Management\" are: Paul Sznewajs & Mary Elizabeth GraettingerThis course is jointly sponsored by Business Institutions and a student organization called campusCatalyst.  The course is taught by a leader in the Chicagoland non-profit community and combines both a consulting experience with area non-profits facing organizational strategy issues with classroom lectures and discussions on the nonprofit sector.  The class is composed of 25 students who are split into teams of five, and matched with local non-profit organizations and Kellogg MBA mentors, to work on quarter-long consulting engagements.  Students directly engage with their client organizations in the field and then collectively meet once per week to discuss issues and problems they are facing with one another and their instructor, as well as to attend a series of classroom lectures on the nonprofit sector.  To inform and guide students' interactions with non-profits, the classroom sessions will provide an overview of the non-profit sector and the growing trends towards greater accountability, transparency and performance management.  Students will explore the changing roles and responsibilities of non-profits, as shaped by both the public and private sector, and they will examine the implications of these trends.  The course curriculum has two parts: 1) introducing students to the so-called Third Sector and the present political and economic systems that influence how it serves the public good and 2) examining business strategy and management and their applicability to non-profits.  The over-arching goal of the course is to create a foundation of knowledge from which students can draw upon as they work together with community non-profits.  This course is an opportunity to innovate, collaborate, learn and apply a new set of skills and knowledge while impacting the community.",

    "ClassOverview": "*INFORMATION IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE*The instructor for \"Business History of the late 20th Century to Today\" is: Matt LevinThis class will explore the history of American business during the past 40 years. Throughout this period, American business has seen a transformation in the way risk is evaluated, capital is raised, and organizations are led.  The \"rules of the game\" during this period have changed radically in terms of corporate control, business management and wealth creation. We will explore the transformations in business and commerce during the past four decades that have led to current trends and problems.Students interested in the recent history of Wall Street, financial markets, and business culture will enjoy this class. It will also appeal to students intrigued by late 20th and early 21st century American society - specifically how business and American industries have influenced America's identity. Those who may want to explore a career in business should find the seminar helpful in preparing for many types of professions across disciplines.Students will be exposed to topics such as leveraged buyouts, junk bonds, venture capital investing, the \"Internet Bubble\", entrepreneurial management, hedge funds, and derivatives. In addition, we will explore public policy trends around issues including corporate takeovers, technology transfers, risk management, government bailouts and business investment. A common theme throughout the quarter will be how capitalism has evolved over the past few decades, and how this has changed the mindset of business professionals and the American workforce. It will be up to you to determine if this evolution has been beneficial or detrimental to American society.This will not be a seminar grounded in heavy technical economic and financial analysis or market theory. You will not need an academic background in economics to understand the topics of the class. No pre-requisites are necessary.Because students are not expected to have previous knowledge of these topics, the reading list is significant. Students are expected to complete readings prior to class. Please refer to the reading list for primary texts that will be used for the class. There will also be supplemental readings, including articles and essays, that will be provided by the instructor.As part of the class, we will have a series of guest lectures by business professionals including investment bankers, CEOs and private equity professionals.",

    "ClassOverview": "The Science Behind Oppression: Biased interpretations of scientific results have been used to justify racial and gender oppression for centuries. It was often argued that people of different races and different genders were fundamentally different, and as such their roles in society should differ as well. Today, many people reject the claim that race and gender have substantial effect on a person's abilities or capacity, but how did we get here? More importantly, how did science help facilitate these claims in the first place?In this course, we will explore the role of science in historical oppression based on race and gender. We will identify key scientific studies and their subsequent legacy to reveal the precarious nature of scientific interpretation in the hands of biased individuals. We will discuss how power structures can infiltrate scientific integrity and propose safeguards to prevent this kind of infiltration in the future.",

We will see how drugs are discovered and developed; how they get to their site of action; what happens when they reach the site of action in their interaction with receptors, enzymes, and DNA; how resistance occurs; how the body gets rid of drugs, and what a medicinal chemist can do to avoid having the body eliminate them before they have produced their desired effect.

As there will be carryover of topics from one quarter to the next, the 3 quarters of the course must be taken in the designated sequence. As there may be continuation of some experiments from one quarter to the next (i.e. a compound synthesized in one quarter may be analyzed in a subsequent quarter), the 3 quarters of the course should be taken in the same academic year. Any deviation from this will require permission of the instructors.The full 3 quarters of this course will cover advanced topics in methods of:Instrumental analysis;Synthesis of inorganic compounds;Synthesis of organic compounds;Spectroscopy.The course is designed for you to work in a \"research environment\". That is, a research project usually requires a variety of different experiments to reach the desired conclusion. This requires sufficient knowledge to use a variety of experimental techniques and to interpret their results. For example: In these courses you will learn and practice specific techniques for synthesis and chemical analysis. You will apply these techniques both to assigned problems and to a problem of your choice at the end of the three courses.CHEMISTRY 350-3: The 3rd course in this sequence covers the very important topic of spectroscopy from a physical chemistry point of view. It deals with the use of various spectroscopic techniques (FTIR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, uv/visible absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy) for structure determination of gas and liquid phase molecules and for kinetics measurements. In addition, you will be asked to design and carry out a 4-week research project at the end of the quarter based on some aspect of course material in the entire Chem 350-1,2,3 sequence.",

Tourists marvel at the size of the sites and empathize with the plight of the towns' inhabitants. However, Campania's destroyed cities have much more to offer than the familiar story of the 79 AD earthquake. Rather than present a static picture of Campania's towns as \"frozen in time,\" this course takes a diachronic approach to the rich archaeological material. Campania was not originally Roman territory and was conquered by force of arms. Pompeii, often presented as an archetypal Roman town, was not Roman at all for most of its existence. Still, at the time of the eruption Campania's cities were thoroughly Romanized; they are now famous for the evidence they provide for Roman daily life. This course will survey key aspects of the evidence, which will include a discussion of current archaeological techniques and fieldwork. The course will also discuss the 18th- and 19th-century uncovering of Campania's cities, which is a story in its own right.",

    "ClassOverview": "During its long history, Byzantium interacted with different foreign civilizations which created their own images of it. Needless to say, those images differ among themselves to the same extent as those civilizations differ from each other. Not that these images are completely unrelated to the \u2018reality', but they reflect it fancifully, which lends an opportunity to think about mechanisms of image-creation.In this course we will study, in chronological order, what was written about Byzantium from the 5th until the 15th century, by Germanic kings and Armenian scholars; by Arabic enemies and Bulgarian disciples; by Georgian monks and Scandinavian mercenaries; Rus' pilgrims and Italian merchants; Roman popes and Spanish diplomats; Jewish travelers and Catholic Crusaders; French novelists and Muscovite princes.In the mid-15th century, the millennium-old Byzantine empire finally collapsed. Its image, however, not only survived but acquired new facets, disentangled from mundane credibility. It was used or rather misused and abused by the European enlighteners, philosophers, politicians, but most actively by the Russian authorities, from the eighteenth-century Empress Catherine the Great to today's President Vladimir Putin. We will look how Byzantium was depicted in literature, from Russia's greatest poet Alexander Pushkin to contemporary Italian philosopher and novelist Umberto Eco. We will analyze literary, political and mass media texts as well as movies (for instance, the Turkish 2012 film, Fetih) and architecture, including American ones: St. Louis Cathedral in St. Louis, Lakewood Memorial Church in Minneapolis, National Shrine of Immaculate Conception in Washington D.C., etc. Finally, we will deal with the most recent events: the Turkish President Recep Erdogan's decision to reconvert Hagia Sophia Cathedral in Istanbul from a museum to a mosque\u2014and the Moscow ideologues' reconceptualization of the annexed Crimea.",

Poland's shifting borders and the complex history and politics they represent provide a unique point of entry into modern European history.

The author, Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, pens the work in order to demonstrate the absurdity of chivalric romances, the bestsellers of his day. The protagonist, Don Quixote, is incapable of understanding the difference between the fictions he reads and the real world around him. While all this happened some four hundred years ago, reading and writing are still central to our everyday lives. In the spirit of Cervantes, we will study his famous text with a focus on the practices of reading and writing\u2014how and why did people read and write in 17th-century Spain? How were different forms of writing connected to class, gender, race, and religion? What did literacy mean in the early modern world and what implications does this have for us today? We will employ different methods of reading (close, distant, collective, etc.) and different forms of writing (analytical, creative, etc.) to gain a better understanding of this key text. The class will be taught in English.",

By carefully examining aesthetic depictions of the \"outlaw\" -from the American \"Cowboy\" to the Argentinian \"Gaucho\"- this course will address not only the role that these figures have played in the construction of national identities, but will also explore their potential for unsettling our conceptions of lawfulness, institutional justice, and ultimately, of the nation itself. Thus, in analyzing written and visual cultural practices that revisit the figure of the criminal, this course will explore topics such as the relationship between legal order and violence, criminality and popular justice, as well as of the (out)law and civil society. Primary readings for this course will include works from Roberto Bola\u00f1o, J. L. Borges, Angela Davis, Gabriela Cabez\u00f3n C\u00e1mara, Franz Kafka, and others.",

    "ClassOverview": "Describing his upbringing as a child of Eastern European immigrants, the Jewish Brazilian novelist Moacyr Scliar (1937-2011) once said, \"At home, you speak Yiddish, eat gefilte fish and celebrate Shabbat. But in the streets, you have soccer, samba, and Portuguese. After a while you feel like a centaur.\" Scliar's fictional explorations of Jewish identity have led the literary scholar Nelson Vieira to observe that the Brazilian writer's stories \"are reminiscent of work by Canadian-Jewish writer Mordecai Richler and the American novelist Philip Roth, both of whom struggle to capture the perplexing and exasperating paradoxes of people who live between two worlds.\" This course will take Vieira's remark as a critical point of departure to read contemporary Jewish literature of the Americas comparatively. Building on critical/theoretical readings, we will explore selected post-WWII novels and short stories published by Jewish writers across North and South America. While such fiction is often framed solely as part of a national tradition, we will look beyond national borders to understand some of the convergences and divergences of Jewish literary discourses which have emerged in different national contexts of the Western Hemisphere. Over the term, we will examine ways in which modern and contemporary Jewish fiction writers have approached themes of religion, culture, assimilation, diaspora, race, gender, sexuality, the legacy of the Holocaust, and other key concerns.",

In addition to France, we will also consider (and students will have the opportunity to do research on) texts and films from elsewhere in Western Europe, the Soviet Union, East Asia, and Latin America.We will read several classics of early film theory that try to define cinema and its potential as an art and/or a mass medium. Beyond film criticism in the narrow sense, these texts ask broader questions about the relationship between art and technology, entertainment and politics, perception and reality. We will also read several works of poetry and fiction that responded in formally innovative ways to the experience of cinema.Films may include: The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920), The Kid (1921), A Page of Madness (1926), Un Chien andalou (1929), S\u00e3o Paulo, Symphony of a Metropolis (1929), A Propos de Nice (1930), and An Amorous History of the Silver Screen (1931).

The notion of the \"cyber\" - its origins in cybernetics and ensuing proliferation of meanings - forms the conceptual core of the course. After considering early definitions of this term, we turn to how Japanese manga, animation, film, and cultural theory explore the ways in which cybernetic technologies, like cyborgs and cyberspace, have expanded our understanding of human subjectivity and agency, transformed social relations, and blurred boundaries between the human and the animal, the biological and the artificial, and the physical and non-physical.",

    "ClassOverview": "The Uncanny in Theory and in Literature\"Uncanny\" is the English word generally used to translate the German \"Unheimlich,\" a category theorized first by Ernst Jentsch, then by Freud, in an essay of that name (1919), and in a different way taken up by Heidegger in the late 1920s and 30s, and finally also by Derrida. It competes with the more traditional notion of \"alienation\" as a categorization of contemporary life, at least in the \"West\" (or if you prefer \"Global North\"). What is explicit in the German word but not in the English is the reference to the \"home\". What however distinguishes the notion of the Unheimlich from previous theories of alienation or estrangement is that the experience no longer can be framed within the mutually exclusive polarity of domestic vs foreign, since the Unheimlich turns out to be most at home in the home, its strangeness reveals itself to be strangely familiar. Formulated in this way, literature emerges as a privileged medium of the Uncanny.In this course, we will retrace its emergence of a theory of the Uncanny in the texts of Freud and Heidegger, each of which reserve a special place for literature as a privileged setting for this \"apparition\": for Freud the story by E. Th. A. Hoffmann, \"The Sandman;\" for Heidegger Sophocles' tragedy, Antigone. If these \u00a8classical\u00a8 articulations of the uncanny in literature can be understood as a challenge to traditional Western notions of self-identity, we will look at some responses to this challenge in texts as diverse as The Odyssey (books 23 k& 24), Oedipus at Colonus, several shorter \"stories\" by Kafka (\"Cares of a Housefather,\"  \"The Silence of the Sirens\") and finally two \"science fiction\" stories adapted for radio: \"Child's Play\" by William Tenn (1948-51) and Robert A. Heinlein's \"The Green Hills of Earth\" (1947).Reading knowledge of German, although desirable, is not required.Freud, \"The Uncanny,\" \"Inhibition, Symptom, Anxiety\"Heidegger, H\u00f6lderlin's Poem The Ister, (Part II)Sophocles, Theban Plays (Oedipus Tyrannos, Antigone, Oedipus at Colonus)E. Th. A. Hoffmann, \"The Sandman\"Kafka, \"The Cares of a Family Man,\" \"The Silence of the Sirens\"William Tenn, \"Child's Play\" (story and radio play adapted by G. Lefferts)Robert A.

    "ClassOverview": "Shame! Histories and Cultures of an EmotionEmotions are integral to our lives and influence how we navigate the social worlds we inhabit. This course explores an emotion that is notoriously difficult to characterize-shame-as it manifests itself in literary and visual media in history and contemporary culture. During the quarter, we will explore the concept of shame in contexts ranging from sexuality studies (transsexuality, #MeToo), to Black feminist theory (white supremacy), post/neo-colonial discourses (Truth and Reconciliation Committee in South Africa), Holocaust and postcolonial studies (survivor guilt), and inequity (poverty and class struggle). We will discuss a variety of materials, selected from a variety of literary texts (J.M. Coetzee, Franz Kafka, Nella Larsen, Primo Levi, Thomas Mann), essays (phenomenology, philosophy, psychoanalysis, cultural studies), film (Boys Don't Cry, reality T.V.), and excerpts from political commissions (TRC in South Africa). Topics for discussion may include: How do we \"read for\" emotion/render emotion legible? What role do identity and identification (gender, race, class, religion, and sexuality) play in shame? Does shame differ from guilt (and why should this matter)? Can shame be political and a social force? Does shame have a history? Is shame a social or a private emotion; a bodily or a psychic reaction? We will pose these and other questions and search for answers to them during the course of the quarter.Included on the syllabus are texts by J.M. Coetzee, Kafka, Nella Larsen, Thomas Mann, Dorothy Allison, and Primo Levi, as well as excerpts from Freud, Foucault, Leys, Sartre, Katz, et al\u2026",

The range and nature of responses to Fanon's work since his time speaks to the continued problem of colonialism, anti-Blackness, and the racialized gender system, as well as the changes in paradigms and discourse surrounding these issues.

    "ClassOverview": "Understanding the formation and evolution of rocky planets, from their inception in the stellar nebula to becoming geologically active space objects that can sometimes support life, is an exceptionally creative scientific quest. It requires application of fundamental physical concepts, such as gravity, heat transport, phase transitions, magnetism, and many others, to natural phenomena that are as common in the lives of planets as they are in our everyday lives. This course will introduce different stages of planetary evolution and the physics behind them. New concepts learned each week will be immediately applied to the planet that each student will be growing (theoretically) throughout the course. Each student will end up with a unique planet, depending on choices that they make at each fork in the road of planetary evolution. The fate of each planet will also be affected by the surprise events, such as asteroid impacts and solar storms, induced by the instructor, which will keep the students on their toes and introduce them to the complexity and unpredictability of natural phenomena. The closely intertwined learning-application structure of the course will facilitate a deeper understanding of general physics, enabling the students to apply them beyond planetary sciences. The unique use of hypothetical (i.e., fantastical) worlds will provide a learning framework where (1) the known attraction of exact sciences is retained (such as the satisfaction of the \u2018right' answer), but (2) the potentially intimidating aspect of misunderstanding a well-established fact is avoided. Fantasy worlds, as the word suggests, are worlds that do not actually exist anywhere in the universe (at least as far as we know), they are only as real as the scientific justification made for them by their creators - the students.",

The lecture portion of the course will highlight/review Earth science concepts, while the modeling component of the course will focus on the design, construction, and use of models to test hypotheses, and increase understanding of the forces and processes that shape the global environment. The modeling software to be used will be appropriate to undergraduates and beginning graduate students who do not have previous experience with solving differential equations or with computer programming, though students with these skill sets will appreciate the manifestation of numerical rules in the software package. Ultimately, this course is designed to empower students with introductory modeling skills that can be used to build a better understanding of how Earth's various components interact and evolve.",

With an emphasis on economic principles, students will be introduced to core terminology and modes of analysis for studying the production and distribution of goods and services in the economy. An overarching goal is to gain insight into how, when, and why markets fail or succeed. Specific topics include supply and demand, market equilibrium, elasticity, costs of production, different degrees of competition (including perfect competition and monopoly), and government interventions (price controls, taxes). You will get started thinking about the three fundamental questions in economics: (i) what goods and services should be produced?, (ii) how do we produce those goods and services?, and (iii) who gets those goods and services? This course is aimed at potential economics majors and students who are curious about having a better understanding of the popular press, or analyzing and comparing different government policies.",

    "ClassOverview": "The environment and our natural resources are scarce yet their values are quite hard to determine. Furthermore, there are a variety of problems with the incentives to use them well. Using the tools of microeconomic analysis and some econometrics, this course will define and examine \"environmental problems\" in terms of economic efficiency. We will also discuss the methods (and shortcomings of these methods) used by economists and policymakers to place dollar values on environmental amenities (since such valuations will determine what policy options are deemed \"efficient\"), such as benefit-cost analysis. Then we will apply these tools to look at a particular set of environmental problems caused by negative externalities transmitted through naturally occurring amenities, and the effects of the policies we construct in response to these problems.

In this this course, we will explore gender and sexuality through the lens of monstrous creatures and spaces that allow for play and possibility\u2014from the wilderness to virtual reality. We'll ask what can octopuses, werewolves, and the Loch Ness Monster do that humans can't? Why do we return to monsters and myths to inform, validate, explain, or investigate our identities? How does this \"return to nature\" intersect with technological innovations that challenge our concept of a fixed human identity? As transphobic and homophobic legislation is on the rise, what effect does the queer imaginary have on queer possibility? Texts and multimedia that we will study include Marie de France's medieval werewolf tale \"Bisclavret,\" Black Mirror's \"Striking Vipers,\" selections from Philosophy Tube, poems from Donika Kelly's Bestiary and a variety of queer cryptid memes and etsy merchandise.",

    "ClassOverview": "What is the role of diversity in U.S. society? How can it help to realize aims such as human flourishing, equality, or liberation? These questions generate very different answers, ranging from early ideas of the US as a melting pot, to the Black feminists of the Combahee River Collective who argued that none of us are free until all of us are free until all of us are free, to the novelist Karen Tei Yamashita who proclaimed in the 1990s that \"cultural diversity is bullshit.\"  This course examines how such writers historically envisioned diversity, multiplicity, and difference in 20th century America. Moving from ideas of assimilation and cross-racial solidarity in the early 20th century to recent understandings of intersectionality and multiculturalism, we will ask: What models have writers formulated to understand and describe difference? What do these accounts tell us about social transformations within the US? And, what are the utopian horizons\u2014and daily contradictions\u2014of living in a multiethnic, multiracial society? Possible readings include: Carlos Bulosan, Richard Wright, Muriel Rukeyser, Amiri Baraka and Hettie Jones, John Cassavetes, the Combahee River Collective, June Jordan, Karen Tei Yamashita, and Ernesto Qui\u00f1onez",

    "ClassOverview": "Whether you come from a small town or rural area, or have always lived in Chicago or some other large city, you likely have heard cities both praised and scorned.  Great restaurants and violent crime, economic opportunity and political corruption, music festivals and homelessness, cities seem to embody all of the prevailing social divisions and contradictions.  In this course, we will think critically about cities by examining how they are represented in fiction and film.  What is the city's relationship to the surrounding area?  What types of thoughts and behaviors does it seem to call for?  What kinds of encounters are typical?  In short, what happens when we treat cities more as \"characters\" than \"settings,\" when we think of Las Vegas as a party animal (What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas), or New York as a cultured gadabout (The city that never sleeps), or Detroit as pugnacious and defiant (Detroit vs. everybody)?  We will begin with two cities that are sharply defined by internal divisions, those in the television series Derry Girls and the film Blade Runner 2049.  From there, we will compare two representations of Las Vegas (The Hangover and Fear and Loathing), and ask what kind of freedom is on offer and what is the cost of such freedom?  Finally, we will visit post-Katrina New Orleans (Treme) and the multicultural London of filmmaker Steve McQueen and author Zadie Smith (Small Axe and NW).",

    "ClassOverview": "How does a minority group fight for recognition in New York City? This course addresses questions of visibility within the Puerto Rican enclave of New York. We will have the opportunity to discuss movie clips from West Side Story to oral performances of poetry. In Luis Rafael S\u00e1nchez's poem \"La guagua a\u00e9rea,\" the following exchange depicts the relationship between the United States and Puerto Rico: \"Which town in Puerto Rico do you come from? With striking ordinariness\u2026she replied - De Nueva York.\" We can compare these lines to the famous West Side Story song that exclaims, \"Nobody knows in America/Puerto Rico's in America!\" Whether asserting that New York is located in Puerto Rico, or that Puerto Rico is in fact in \"America,\" one thing is certain: the boundary between the United States and Puerto Rico is extremely blurry, malleable and, one may even argue, subjective. Through poetry, memoirs, and short stories, Nuyorican/Puerto Rican literature represents an in-betweenness via references to, and often nostalgia for, the Island. This course will explore the violence and rehabilitation of Down These Mean Streets, the crying out of Nuyorican poetry and the impact of the memoir as a genre. We will consider how interracial dynamics and border theory influence Latinx literature, including Nuyorican slam poetry, and we will analyze how the past affects contemporary literature, which speaks out against stereotypes of poverty, welfare, and social status.",

    "ClassOverview": "Growing up is hard to do, whether in southern Italy in the 1950s or in Sacramento in 2002. This course will explore the literature of growing up and consider some of the challenges presented by difficult parents, deceptive friends, and turbulent circumstances. How do characters negotiate hurdles and forge their own identities? We will look at the novel My Brilliant Friend (Elena Ferrante) and consider a variety of other texts, including the films Ladybird, The Virgin Suicides, and The Perks of Being a Wallflower; the graphic novel Persepolis; the shows Derry Girls and Never Have I Ever; and short pieces from Jamaica Kincaid and Viet Than Nguyen. How are identities both modeled on and forged in opposition to those around us? How do we maintain stability when the community around us is dangerous and unstable? What happens when we outgrow a friend or have a fundamental disagreement with a parent? In this seminar, we will use literature and film to investigate the coming-of-age narrative and to consider these questions and others.",

    "ClassOverview": "What makes a world, and what does it mean to travel between worlds? For Lewis Carroll's Alice, stumbling headfirst into a rabbit-hole leads to her immersion in a dizzying landscape of talking flowers and cross-species tea parties. In Tolkien's \"The Hobbit\" (or, fittingly, \"There and Back Again\"), Bilbo's idyllic world of the Shire gives way to terrains, beings, and dangers unknown as soon as Gandalf knocks on his door. In the classical myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, the trauma of his lover's untimely death compels the titular hero to brave Hades' underworld, and in the medieval retelling, \"Sir Orfeo\", he instead travels through a rock into a fairy Otherworld as he attempts to recover Heurodis from the supernatural king who has kidnapped her. In this course, we will consider different forms of inter-world travel and the conditions of sociality that necessitate a departure from (and sometimes a return to) a world we call \"ours.\" How are environments constituted or unmade by their inhabitants and the interpersonal, affective, and political investments that orient them? How are we changed by the experience of glimpsing the \"otherwise\"?",

    "ClassOverview": "Part travelogue, part memoiristic musings, and part photo essay, A Stranger's Pose (2018) traces Emmanual Iduma's travels around the northern and western parts of Africa. Iduma's protean text will ground our conversations this quarter about approaches to Africa and African cultural production as well as our interrogation of borders, race and questions of movement. Along the way, we will also look at journalism, personal essays, theoretical articles and photographic work by writers, thinkers and photographers such as Nanjala Nyabola, Ashraf Jamal, Teju Cole, Yvonne Adhiambo Owuor, A\u00efda Muluneh and Santu Mofokeng. Throughout the class, we will be asking: what does it mean to see and read Africa? What different modalities of thinking about and understanding of race, borders and mobility do writing and photography offer? What does it mean to be a traveller and to encounter others ethically? At the same time, we will be asking: what does it mean to read critically and to write effectively? You will thus not only learn to cultivate strategies for critically approaching different types of texts, but you will also learn to approach writing as a dynamic process, as a tool for thinking and for communication. In addition to learning how to develop and construct compelling arguments through the effective use of evidence, you and your classmates will learn to support each other by giving and receiving constructive feedback in peer review. While this class will mostly ask you to write in conventional academic genres, I hope that you will leave the class feeling equally equipped to think precisely and to communicate effectively in other professional and/or informal modes.",

    "ClassOverview": "While print novel and magazine readership may be down, podcast listening is hugely popular. Podcasts are now where many people encounter news, pop culture, and stories. Good podcast creators\u2014of both fiction and nonfiction podcasts\u2014engage in the art of storytelling, making carefully crafted plots, characters, settings, and themes. This course will expose students to narrative theory and storytelling tools and then teach them to apply these concepts to podcasts. Just as they do with written texts in other courses, students in this course will learn to consider podcasts using close-\"reading\" techniques, rhetorical argumentation, and character, plot, and setting analyses. In addition to these more classical academic analyses of podcasts as literature, the course will also ask students to consider the serial and documentary genres. Furthermore, students will consider how technology affects storytelling. In the first half of the course, students will analyze existing podcasts and write academic papers on the podcasts of their choosing. In the second half of the class, students will make 2 podcasts themselves. One of the podcasts will be an original podcast of their choosing. The other podcast will be a class project wherein students make a podcast that gives other students tips and tricks to improve their writing processes.",

Since time will not permit a complete reading, we will concentrate on those books that display the greatest literary interest or influence. From the Torah we will read Genesis, Exodus, and parts of Deuteronomy; from the Prophets, Amos, Jonah, Second Isaiah, and Daniel; and from the Writings, the books of Judges, Ruth, Psalms, and the Song of Songs, along with the saga of King David and portions of the Wisdom literature.

We then explore the emergence of modernist poetry and dance in the first two decades of the 20th century as a trans-Atlantic movement that circulated through Europe and the Americas. The years from the 1930s through the 1950s saw a push to nationalize these movements, although transnational currents remained. Then the global protests of 1968 interrupted and redirected the relations of art and politics in ways that continue to inform modernist dance and poetry in the 21st century.",

We will begin by studying Chicano and Nuyorican literary texts from the 1960s and 1970s and will conclude with work by newer voices Justin Torres, Carmen Maria Machado, and Xochitl Gonz\u00e1lez. Our readings will represent various literary genres, voices, and discourses that exemplify the various styles of writing created by a diverse group of national, ethnic, racial, and gendered subjects. We will emphasize historical continuities since the 1960s and 70s, while also exploring the relationship between genres and emerging social issues. By the end of the semester students will have a historical overview of the heterogeneous literary voices and aesthetics that constitute US Latinx literature as well as an awareness of the internal debates around the creation of a Latinx canon in the US.",

    "ClassOverview": "Recent bestsellers such as The Girl on the Train and My Sister, the Serial Killer are part of a long legacy of wildly popular murder mysteries. In the early nineteenth century, murder, madness, and illicit sexuality were often confined to remote Gothic castles or the wilds of the English moors. With the rise of detective stories in the United States and sensation fiction in Britain, however, these middle-class nightmares invaded the supposedly blissful domestic scene. Writers also started to use murder as an occasion to pose radical questions about which deaths are considered \"grievable.\" Beginning with bestselling authors Edgar Allen Poe and Wilkie Collins, this seminar follows the transatlantic tradition forward through Pauline Hopkins (author of the first Black murder mystery), gritty detective fiction by Chester B. Himes, and mid-twentieth-century thrillers by Daphne du Maurier. Paying particular attention to how gender and race shape the narration of these tales, the course will conclude with a survey of current chart-toppers by Paula Hawkins, Oyinkan Braithwaite, and others. Readings will be supplemented with films and prestige dramas, including the 2016 adaptation of The Girl on the Train and 2020's The Undoing.",

How does YA speculative fiction, with its interest in utopian and dystopian societies, think through the moral dilemmas and new possibilities that await us? Focusing particularly on speculative fiction by Queer and BIPOC authors, this class will ask how these texts respond to questions of fascism and governmental control, climate change, technology, gender and sexuality, disability, and race. We will investigate speculative YA fiction through the lenses of childhood studies, queer theory, Afrofuturism, environmentalism, and disability studies, to name only a few. In so doing, we will ask: how does speculative fiction help us imagine new possible futures? And why are young adult characters-and readers-the prime site for exploring these concerns?",

    "ClassOverview": "For most of the twentieth century, scholars thought there were virtually no medieval women writers.  \"Everyone knew\" that women couldn't read and the Church didn't allow them to write.  But the feminist revolution changed all that, as dozens of women writers were rediscovered, edited, and translated.  Yet even today, some of the most widely read medieval women still pose challenges.  In this class we will read four women writers in depth, giving us time to delve into the critical literature and discuss the issues that vex their place in the canon.  In the twelfth century, the popular romance poet Marie de France (who wrote in French but lived in England) proudly signed her work\u2014because she feared, with good reason, that \"some cleric\" or learned man would claim credit for it.  Late medieval England's most important women writers, Julian of Norwich and Margery Kempe (who knew each other), were long consigned to a religious ghetto.  Kempe in addition was pathologized as a hysterical female.  Finally, the prolific French writer Christine de Pizan became the first professional author in Europe\u2014that is, the first of either sex to support herself and her family solely by writing. She was translated into English in the early modern period.  Despite her explicit feminism, however, her signed works were often ascribed not to her, but to their male translators.  This course will have a triple focus on the texts themselves, the difficulties faced by medieval women writers in their time, and their post-medieval reception.",

Likewise, cultural anxieties about sex and gender often center on books, as recent calls to ban texts with queer themes from schools and libraries around the U.S. demonstrate. To make sense of the fascinating, often fraught relationship between sex, gender, and written media, this course focuses on a key period in Anglophone literary and sexual history: the so-called Renaissance, when book production exploded thanks to the printing press and England was rocked by rapid cultural, racial, and religious upheaval. Examining representations of sex and gender in books, manuscripts, maps, printed images, and other textual media from sixteenth- and seventeenth-century England, we will ask: how did different communities share ideas about sex? What could be published in print and what had to stay private? What texts survive today, and why? What distinguishes art from obscenity? In the process of exploring these questions, students will have the opportunity to work hands-on with premodern books.",

Although spurred in large part by technological innovations such as the advent of railway travel, this revolution also unfolded in the pages of newspapers, novels, and other literary texts. This course will explore how literature shaped meanings and experiences of travel across the nineteenth century. How did Romantic poetry help transform the mundane act of walking into a respected leisure activity (aka \"hiking\")? How did Victorian novels help process the shock of railway travel? How did Black transatlantic writers give voice to diasporic experience within a predominantly white British literary marketplace? These questions will take us through the English countryside, along dark Victorian streets, and across the Atlantic, guided by authors including William and Dorothy Wordsworth, William Hazlitt, Mary Prince, Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, Mary Seacole, and Bram Stoker. While exploring how nineteenth-century authors used representations of travel to grapple with pressing issues of their day, we will also consider the ongoing legacies of these issues in contemporary culture and lived experience.

    "ClassOverview": "The word \"Victorian\" exudes a certain stuffiness, a corseted and stiff-lipped repression characteristic of, and confined to, a distinct historical moment. Comparing modern sexual mores to those of the past, however, Michel Foucault notoriously deems us \"other Victorians\" in our erotic predilections and preoccupations, suggesting far less has changed since the nineteenth century than we might like to believe. By examining a number of nineteenth-century novels that particularly grapple with issues of desire, eroticism, and consent alongside queer and feminist scholarship, this course will investigate questions of sexual identity, desire, gender conformity, and fluidity, that remain provocative today.Melodramatic, sensational, sensual, and challenging, texts like Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights, Thomas Hardy's Tess of the D'Urbervilles, and Vernon Lee's A Phantom Lover give us the opportunity to reconsider what the Victorians often referred to as \"the Woman Question\": a growing social conservatism in response to changing gender conventions in no way confined to a single sex. How do these narratives negotiate questions of consent and kinship in response to growing calls during the period for gender equality? And what does the Victorian novel have to tell us\u2014\"we other Victorians\"\u2014about ways of thinking about sexual difference, deviance, and desire?",

    "ClassOverview": "Novels often describe real and complete worlds that is proximate to our own, with entirely imaginary people going about their daily lives as if in a continuous hut parallel universe.  This process is called worldling and is now an established concept. But what happens when the contract with the \"real world\" is broken and instead writing reanimates myths, folktales, legends, and more within the real? What kinds of new worlds does this open up and how might it interfere with the conception of literature?Around 1950, Latin American writers began to break away from \"realist\" writing to explore a realm between the real and the magical, giving rise to what is now the established style of \"magical realism.\"To understand this overall movement from realism to magical realism, this course will begin with a consideration of realist writing and its reliance on the simulation of reality, aka verisimilitude, in the first few weeks. After understanding some basic tenets of realism, we will turn to Latin American, South Asian, and American sites of magical realism that stage a revolt against the dictates of the real.  We will consider how paying close attention to the deployment of this style can yield significant political interventions, particularly around anti-imperial and anti-racist discourses. Fiction will include texts like Gabriel Garcia Marquez's The Chronicle of a Death Foretold, Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses, and Toni Morrison's The Song of Solomon. The course will also foray into theoretical work that helps to situate the importance of magical realism and its variations.

While the humanities seem to focus on subjectivity and feeling, we see the sciences as objective and fact-based. Yet attending to the history of medicine demands a troubled acknowledgement that medical inquiry both shapes and is itself shaped by cultural assumptions about race and gender. Indeed, critics have pointed time and again to how the seeming impartiality of medical fact reveals biases about which kinds of bodies feel pain and who is prone to certain diseases, distinctions that have been assigned moral and social meaning. In this class, we will read literature about medical encounters in order to investigate how ideas about race and gender shape medical experiences. How do these individual accounts reflect larger structural injustices? What kinds of barriers and assumptions do women and people of color face when they receive treatment? What about people seeking gender affirming care? Beginning with the nineteenth century and moving towards the present day, we will examine the surprising history of how medical knowledge often depended on the exploitation of racialized bodies, grapple with the tangled enmeshment of femininity and illness, and explore how claims about medicalized bodies became a metric for citizenship.",

Rather, this course is one that thinks black feminist theory and theorizing; this course chronicles the ways that the political, intellectual, ethical, and social resound radically and progressively and names that resonance\u2014and all its vibrations and textures\u2014black feminist theory. Thus, we will, of course, be reading a variety of black women along the jagged gendered spectrum between and beyond \"cis\" and \"trans,\" but more specifically we will, in this course, be tracing the ways radical politics and ethics arise in such a way as to interrogate the established parameters of race and gender normativity. To do this, we will be reading the work of people like bell hooks and Patricia Hill Collins, Toni Morrison and Zora Neale Hurston, Jennifer Nash and Hortense Spillers, and more.",

How about \"interesting,\" \"zany,\" \"#oddlysatisfying,\" or -- reaching back into the past -- \"beautiful\" or even \"sublime\"? This course explores questions of aesthetic judgment through a sustained and in-depth reading of literary theorist Sianne Ngai's 2012 book Our Aesthetic Categories: Zany, Cute, Interesting. Along the way we will read selections from authors writing in earlier periods (Kant, Lyotard) and major influences on Ngai (Marx, Cavell). We will also consider more recent and primarily internet-based categories of aesthetic judgment as well as possible alternatives to \"judgment\" (such as when art serves as a prop for self care; or when the term \"aesthetic\" signals a lifestyle, e.g. \"cottage core,\" \"dark academia,\" etc). This course is designed to appeal to students interested in reading and writing at the intersections of literature, art, philosophy, and mass culture in 20th- and 21st-century western cultures. It is also designed as one possible introduction to the broad field of writings often called \"literary theory.\" To ground our discussion we will analyze a variety of works across genres and media, including videogames, literature, and experimental film and video.",

    "ClassOverview": "From the Civil Rights Movement to the AIDS crisis to the legalization of gay marriage, LGBT art and activism have been deeply intertwined.  Queer writers in the U.S. have negotiated ever-shifting priorities and stigmas to represent queer life in literature and media. Yet stories have always been a way to have a voice, to account for oneself and one's community, and to connect to others who share one's experience. LGBTQ literature might be outward facing\u2014representing queerness to a straight audience\u2014or it might face inwards, speaking to a queer community of readers. This class will consider the relationship between sociopolitical movements and the art and literature that were produced from or around them. Focusing on flashpoints in the history of LGBTQ rights and culture in the United States, students will leave this course with a concrete sense of recent history, artistic diversity, and intersectional queer studies. In addition to a core set of literary and historical texts, students will give queer culture presentations on each of the primary periods this class covers. These presentations will provide the opportunity to bring in objects from outside of the class, which will supplement our understanding of queer art and activism.",

Focusing on the sound era this course introduces students to the study of Hollywood cinema as a mode of industrial cultural production at the dynamic intersection of art and mass culture. Our approach will be to study one film per week with an emphasis on formal analysis supplemented by readings from film theory and history. Films will likely include Stagecoach (1939), Sullivan's Travels (1941), Now, Voyager (1942), Double Indemnity (1944), and Singin' in the Rain (1952), among others.

    "ClassOverview": "Breaking the rules is a fundamental aspect of growing up, but some transgressions have more serious consequences than others, particularly for those who do not have the option of second and third chances. How do we push against the life stories that have been chosen for us? In this seminar, we will look at a variety of coming-of-age texts dealing with the development of identity, the loss of innocence, and the subversion of narratives. We'll consider the questions: How do friendships help to shape us, and how is betrayal a part of growing up? How do we navigate parental expectations that do not match with our own dreams or desires? How are the stakes different and higher for those who are not a part of the dominant culture? We will look at three novels that complicate the coming-of-age story in distinct ways: Elena Ferrante's Neapolitan tale My Brilliant Friend; Kazuo Ishiguro's dystopian elegy Never Let Me Go; and Cameroonian writer Ferdinand Oyono's epistolary anti-colonial work Houseboy. In addition to these texts, we will consider Marjane Satrapi's graphic novel Persepolis and a variety of films: Greta Gerwig's Ladybird, Stephen Chbosky's The Perks of Being a Wallflower, Sofia Coppola's The Virgin Suicides, and Jordan Peele's Us. Standing on the brink of adulthood, with one foot still partially in childhood, it can feel as though small decisions can have outsized consequences, and the people who should be the most supportive can create the biggest obstacles. We will use these novels and films to interrogate the conventional coming-of-age narrative and to raise questions about the hard work of defining ourselves against strong and sometimes dangerous forces-and the loss that may happen along the way.",

    "ClassOverview": "This selective-enrollment, yearlong \"Sequence\" is designed to make students increasingly informed readers and self-sustaining apprentices of poetry.  The Fall portion of the course begins with summer reading and intensive study in which poets learn to identify operative modes in poetry\u2014including description, rhetoric, story and song\u2014and begin connecting contemporary participants with root systems in the tradition. We support our studies with reading exercises and \"imitation\" assignments, in which students convert close reading into fodder for original writing. Students will write at least four papers and will write, workshop and revise four poems during the Fall term. They also will lead presentations on one chosen poet and one classmate during workshop. In the Winter term, students will continue to read and complete close reading assignments and will stretch their skills as they complete a week of \"Daily Poems,\" thereby drawing on original energy and stamina to bring their work to the next level of accomplishment. Finally, in the Spring term, students will focus entirely on their own work, drafting, revising, workshopping and completing one long poem of at least 120 lines that combines autobiographical material with writing from research. Throughout the year, our close reading assignments hone skills in sensitive and critical thinking; our imitation poems challenge existing habits as they introduce new strategies; our Daily Poems exercise agility and confidence; and our workshops cultivate the openness and humility necessary to serious writing and lifelong learning. Through this intensive and nurturing Sequence, students become careful readers of each others' work and complete a polished portfolio of original writing.",

We'll be engaged in the reading of a concise, funny book on the craft of fiction, and we'll also be reading a wide and varied array of short stories. Again, though, this work is geared to do one simple thing: to find out what means and modes of expression you best respond to, and to figure out ways to approach this question: Given all the other potentially more awesome forms of entertainment out there, what is the role of sitting around scribbling things and reading other people's scribblings? Why do it? Just so you know, what we're doing in class closely replicates what all successful fiction writers do on a daily basis: reading the work of their peers and those of established and emerging authors with care, attention, and greed, and writing copious amounts to see what sticks.

An understanding of this complex phenomenon is vital not only for an understanding of modern history and geography, but also for modern literature.  Lenin and Arendt draw diametrically opposed interpretations of Hobson's original theory of imperialism:  while Lenin understands imperialism as the last stage of capitalism, Arendt believes it is the first stage of rule by the bourgeoisie.  At stake in this debate, at least for Arendt, is the ability of an interpretation of imperialism to explicate works of literature written under imperialist conditions.  With a focus on the \"Age of Imperialism\" (especially the \"scramble for Africa\" and \"the Great Game\"), we will begin the class with an examination of some of the central theories and interpretations of European imperialism (those of Marx, Hobson, Lenin, and Arendt); continue with an exploration of the historical conditions of certain imperialized regions (India, Congo Free State, and Nigeria); and make use of both inquiries as we confront some of the most lucid and powerful literary encounters with imperialism in this century, including works by Kipling, Conrad, Achebe, and Desai.",

We will begin by examining the rhetorical treatises and schoolroom exercises that put person-making at the center of classical and medieval educational programs, indeed treated it as an essential part of becoming a well-educated adult, as well as a vital moral exercise of putting one's self in somebody else's shoes. We will then go on to read a series of early texts whose character-making proved to be especially influential, including all or part of Prudentius' gruesome Psychomachia, Boethius' stately Consolation of Philosophy, Mechthild of Magdeburg's erotically charged Flowing Light of the Godhead, Chaucer's comical House of Fame, and Langland's politically volatile Piers Plowman. Are these premodern characters relatively homogenous, or do they differ in important respects?  How are they similar to, and how are they different from, modern novelistic characters? More broadly, how are they \"good to think with\"? What kinds of reading practices do they encourage or discourage? As we seek to answer these questions, we will read a range of critical and theoretical texts about character formation that will lay the groundwork for students' final presentations and papers, which may consider non-novelistic characters in medieval and/or post-medieval literary works",

    "ClassOverview": "Environmental Justice in Modern South Asia is an undergraduate class on the unequal experiences and effects of environmental change in South Asia, drawing primarily on case studies from India. Since at least the early 1990s, rapid economic growth, massive infrastructural projects, democratic transformations and global threats of climate change have characterized the South Asian region. Such political, economic, and ecological processes come together to worsen the lives and livelihoods of marginalized people typically. They tend to intensify their vulnerability to environmental degradation, with historical structures of inclusion and exclusion profoundly shaping how natural resources are accessed and distributed. While the regional focus is on South Asia, at the heart of this course is a broader concern that environmental questions are always questions of equality and social justice.The class will examine how issues of justice and nature are framed within law and official policy debates, within social movements and right-based struggles, as well as within people's moral imaginations and everyday lives.  The following questions will guide the class:\u2022\tWhat environmental problems arose in South Asia through accelerated economic development across the 20th century and early 21st century?\u2022\tWho suffered the most, why, and how were they affected, socially, culturally, and materially?\u2022\tWhat strategies for justice and sustainability emerged?\u2022\tHow is environmental justice understood across activists, policymakers, and ordinary people whose lives are most in danger?",

This course serves as an introduction to French and francophone culture and politics through the lens of hip-hop, music, and cinema. We will examine the intersections between hip hop, local literary practices, and political contexts which allows for the emergence of different varieties of francophone hip hop. We will explore how these different forms of aesthetic production critique and contribute to a number of public debates on topics such as French republicanism, national identity, im/migration, as well as language, economic hardship, and colonialism. By taking hip hop as our point of departure, we will gain a broader understanding of how individuals produce meaning about the everyday though language and artistic creation.",

This course is designed especially for students planning a career in the health professions, global health, and/or public health.\" In this course, students will gain knowledge of the different models of healthcare systems in Francophone countries as well as familiarity with some specific terminologies and grammatical structures employed in the field. Using communicative and task-based approaches, students will discuss current issues, examine and reflect on ethical beliefs and values, through topics such as healthcare access, terminal illness, the use of technology etc.Class discussions and activities as well as written assignments will be based on videos, press articles, and on the reading of a short novel related to the medical field. Students will research topics and share their findings through oral presentations. They will also explore their personal area of interest in the field.Students' testimonies: \"This course teaches so much not just about the technical aspects of health and healthcare, but also provides a well-rounded approach to the French language and the cultures of Francophone countries. Taking this course allowed me to expand my vocabulary, practice my reading and oral comprehension skills, and perfect my presentation techniques through exploring my own topics of interest. I highly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in healthcare or even just French language and culture!\"\"I really appreciated taking a French class such as this one. For the most part, I've never really encountered coursework in French that integrates my passions in my both major and my intended career path. This course allowed for that intersection, and not only taught me more about the various domains and approaches in medicine, but also emphasized the perspectives of the people involved, which I believe is very important to understand working in a field that is very reliant on human services.\"",

A familiar everyday event that ordinarily might annoy but eventually gets the traveler to their destination. However, here, unbeknownst both to our travelers and to us, this is no ordinary detour but rather a crossroad where chance and destiny converge. We begin our course with this short story to explore not only the daunting and often unanswerable question of \"is it chance? Is it desinty?\" but also the relationship between storytelling and this double question. Focusing our analyses and discussions on different modalities of encounter, we will investigate the history of key notions in the debate on chance and destiny, beginning with these words themselves, and consider their broader political and historical implications. Our class topic is not limited to human-human encounters but rather expands to consider encounter as a relation in general. Students will contribute to the structure of the class not only theoretically and critically but also by drawing on their own everyday experiences of encounter and stories.",

Beyond film criticism in the narrow sense, these texts ask broader questions about the relationship between art and technology, entertainment and politics, perception and reality. We will also read several works of poetry and fiction that responded in formally innovative ways to the experience of cinema.Films may include: The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920), The Kid (1921), A Page of Madness (1926), Un Chien andalou (1929), S\u00e3o Paulo, Symphony of a Metropolis (1929), A Propos de Nice (1930), and An Amorous History of the Silver Screen (1931).

How did the eroticized body of the Beloved in the love sonnet become the wounded flesh of the Huguenot soldier during the Wars of Religion? How did the anatomized female form in the blason come to represent European nations torn apart by civil strife? We will examine structural and formal conventions as well as historical and political contexts to discern conversations between our texts and the turbulent times in which they were created.

How is medical science influenced by economic and political institutions and by patient mobilization? How does social and economic inclusion/exclusion govern access to treatment as well as care of the self and others?

Our focus will be on human reproduction, considering the vantage points of both healthcare practitioners and lay women and men. We will look at ideas concerning fertility, conception, pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth, birth control, abortion, and assisted reproduction. Because, at a fundamental level, reproduction is about power - as historian Amy Kaler (but by no means only Kaler), pointed out, \"[c]control over human reproduction is eternally contested, in zones ranging from the comparative privacy of the conjugal bedroom to the political platform and programs of national polities\" - we will pay attention to power in reproductive health. And, since the distribution of power in matters of reproduction has often been uneven and unequal - between men and women, between colonizing and Indigenous populations, between clinicians and lay people, between those in upper socioeconomic classes and those in lower socioeconomic classes - we will pay particular attention during this class to struggles over matters of reproduction as we explore historical changes and continuities in reproduction globally since 1900.Fulfills Area IV (Historical Studies) distribution requirement",

Fiction, non-fiction, poems, memoirs, novels, young adult fiction, science fiction, mysteries, fantasy, fairy tales, horror, magical realism, and so many other genres influence our definitions of health or wellbeing. They give us insight into how other folks imagine and understanding situations we may or may not find ourselves in. The best text allow us to empathize with the characters or authors or challenge what we thought we knew. When thinking up this course, books that came to mind included \"The Cancer Journals,\"  \"The Marrow Thieves,\" \"Crying in H Mart,\" \"Convenience Store Woman,\" \"Medical Apartheid,\" \"What the Eyes Don't See,\" \"All About Love: New Visions,\" and \"We Are Never Meeting in Real Life.\" Our course will consider some of these and other genres noted above. You'll be asked to propose a book to read/listen to and a list of various text will also be provided if you need guidance in choosing a text. You will learn how these text influence or challenge norms about health and well-being. Professor Reyes will help you access books that aren't easily available or affordable.",

This reading-intensive, discussion-based seminar will provide students with a complex and in-depth understanding of the historical and contemporary policies and systems created for, by, and in collaboration with Native nations. In order to understand the U.S. government's role and responsibility towards Native nations, we will delve into legal foundations of the trust responsibility and fiduciary obligation of the federal government as outlined in the U.S. Constitution and Supreme Court decisions. To understand how Native nations have worked within colonial settler systems to maintain or expand their sovereignty, students will examine notable federal and state policies that affect Native health, wellbeing, and (lack of) access to meaningful care.",

Course readings will consist of text that provides a critical lens to view qualitative data collection methods through and will include studies in historical and traumatic violence that underscore how people living in Black bodies work to survive by Joy DeGruy and the negotiating processes that Black individuals use to exercise agency and evaluate systemic oppressions that impede how they navigate life as articulated by authors such as Patricia Hill Collins, Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw, Richard Delgado, and Jean Stefancic.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course offers a study of Berlin, Germany's world-famous role as a major center of contemporary dance music (techno, house, disco) and nightclub culture. Beginning in the 1990s with the end of the Cold War and the reunification of Berlin, the city quickly became home to cutting-edge DJs, party planners, club owners, and dancers, including notorious clubs like Tresor and Berghain. Coming together, they pioneered new ways to express oneself and connect with one another through music and dance.This course examines many aspects of this culture, from the unique genres of music and how DJs create music to the technology of sound, the experience of dancing and of clubs as spaces, and the politics of belonging, representation, and identity on the dancefloor, in particular its complicated exchanges with Black communities and music in Chicago and Detroit, the birthplaces of this music. We also will consider the social, cultural, and political implications of nightlife and dance music as a site of community-building, friendship, and love within contemporary Western society, especially for queer communities.As our course is a First-Year Seminar, we will discuss various aspects of college academic life. Moreover, our writing assignments will be the core of this course's exploration of dance music and culture. Through our writing, we will learn how to interpret what others have said and made and how to make knowledge ourselves. Each week, we will practice and discuss a specific component of the writing process, from asking good questions to finding sources, synthesizing what others' have said, and constructing arguments. We will hone our skills in crafting college-level writing through summative, comparative, analytic, and research writing assignments as well as practices of revision and editing.There will also be an experiential component to the course involving workshops with DJs in which you will engage in a hands-on approach to topics such as the work of DJing and making music and the politics and logistics of dance.",

How has the relationship of the viewer to images, the screen, and the audience changed over the course of the past century?This course is taught entirely in German and emphasizes developing cultural knowledge and German language skills.

    "ClassOverview": "Film is the progeny of a period of unprecedented modernization and  industrialization, with its development both mirroring and exceeding its birthplace of the expanding metropolis. Drawing on a wide range of classical and lesser-known (but mesmerizing) films from the Weimar period onward, we will consider how space and social relationships are imagined in the national and increasingly transnational space of the urban metropolis. We will analyze an array of prominent visual and thematic tropes in German films and cinematic history-including: outsiders; crowds, mobs and masses; patriots versus cosmopolitans; reason versus feeling; technology versus human; \"Bildung,\" ; \"Heimat\"; and distraction and spectatorship-specifically through formal and aesthetic cinematic analysis, consideration of the historical and cultural specificity of each film, the close reading of a selection of classical texts on modernity, mass society, and cosmopolitanism, and the exploration of theories of space, cultures of memory, and globalization.",

    "ClassOverview": "Communicating Correctly, Clearly, and Persuasively through VOCABULARYThis course focuses on reviewing and developing German vocabulary using a variety of indirect (incidental) and direct (intentional) methods of vocabulary learning. Why is a large vocabulary important for second language acquisition? A large and robust vocabulary is one of the most important indicators of language proficiency in general, and reading proficiency in particular.  As a matter of fact, student achievement can be explained as much by vocabulary size as by academic ability, even in the first language. In order for students to advance in their foreign language proficiency to a C1 level on the CEFR scale (or an advanced level on the ACTFL proficiency scale)  it is estimated that learners need to acquire at least 1,000 base words per year to reach the 4000-5000 base words necessary for comprehension of authentic sources and literary texts. The goal of this course is to encourage and facilitate the review and acquisition of intermediate- and advanced-level vocabulary items in German through explicit vocabulary instruction which aims at engaging students in actively thinking about word meanings, the relationships among words, and how we can use words in different situations.  Short reading, writing, speaking and listing exercises will help students refine vocabulary depth which includes learning about grammar constructions and collocations, connotations, register, and style. Studying words directly will improve vocabulary breadth, which refers to the understanding of meaning in various contexts.  Students will study and commit words to memory through a variety  of well-established activities including researching learning opportunities through technology as well as understanding and working with google translate.",

Through a study of select literary texts, non-fiction essays, and films, we will explore how the author engages with (or, alternatively, rejects engagement with) the socio-cultural environment through the counter-discourse of literature. Topics of particular focus will include: representation of the National Socialist past; inter-generational conflict in German society; the \u2018terrorist' movement of the 1970s; the politicized climate of the women's movement; the response of the writer in East Germany; the role of historical memory in contemporary Germany; and the politics of national unification and citizenship.",

    "ClassOverview": "\"Uncanny\" is the English word generally used to translate the German \"Unheimlich,\" a category theorized first by Ernst Jentsch, then by Freud, in an essay of that name (1919), and in a different way taken up by Heidegger in the late 1920s and 30s, and finally also by Derrida. It competes with the more traditional notion of \"alienation\" as a categorization of contemporary life, at least in the \"West\" (or if you prefer \"Global North\"). What is explicit in the German word but not in the English is the reference to the \"home\". What however distinguishes the notion of the Unheimlich from previous theories of alienation or estrangement is that the experience no longer can be framed within the mutually exclusive polarity of domestic vs foreign, since the Unheimlich turns out to be most at home in the home, its strangeness reveals itself to be strangely familiar. Formulated in this way, literature emerges as a privileged medium of the Uncanny.In this course, we will retrace its emergence of a theory of the Uncanny in the texts of Freud and Heidegger, each of which reserve a special place for literature as a privileged setting for this \"apparition\": for Freud the story by E. Th. A. Hoffmann, \"The Sandman;\" for Heidegger Sophocles' tragedy, Antigone. If these \u00a8classical\u00a8 articulations of the uncanny in literature can be understood as a challenge to traditional Western notions of self-identity, we will look at some responses to this challenge in texts as diverse as The Odyssey (books 23 k& 24), Oedipus at Colonus, several shorter \"stories\" by Kafka (\"Cares of a Housefather,\"  \"The Silence of the Sirens\") and finally two \"science fiction\" stories adapted for radio: \"Child's Play\" by William Tenn (1948-51) and Robert A. Heinlein's \"The Green Hills of Earth\" (1947).",

    "ClassOverview": "In recent years, Walter Benjamin has become one of the most quoted media theorists. His philosophy of technology is not as widely known as the concept of aura he developed in his essay The Work of Art in the Age of Its Technological Reproducibility. The contemporary relevance of his philosophy of technology lies in the fact that Benjamin establishes a connection between technology and different forms of habitation, and between the latter and the concept of habit (Gewohnheit), which is etymologically related to the concept of habitation (Wohnen). This enables a comparison of Benjamin's approach with the philosophies of technology developed by Heidegger, Deleuze/Guattari, and Simondon, all of whom associate technology with the shaping of environments and the problem of poesis. In our seminar, we will reconstruct Benjamin's media anthropology of technology through a close reading of his diaries and essays and compare it to philosophies of technology very much being discussed today.",

This course critically explores drag as an art form and platform of expression that unsettles normative gender performance. Drawing from academic fields such as performance studies and queer and trans* studies, this seminar centers the analysis of gender through drag and cross-dressing in different contexts in the Americas by relying on concepts such as performativity, race, gender, class, sexuality, and coloniality. In exploring diverse case studies that call for historical and socio-cultural specificity, students will also analyze drag as a type of political performance and a site of contestation of societal norms. In so doing, we will explore gender as an unstable concept by using examples from theater, dance, TV, film, and popular culture. By the end of the quarter, students will develop skills in academic writing, performance analysis, and interpretation of queer and gender theory. Assignments will include written work that will require students to analyze theoretical, performance, and visual works, peer-review exercises, a creative written piece on a fictional drag persona, and a final research paper that centers a drag figure or practice not covered during the quarter.",

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: Coalitional Politics & Case studies from Chicago and beyond: archiving the past for the presentIn this seminar, we explore several 1970s-era projects in Chicago and beyond that exemplify a coalitional feminist politics and consider the usefulness of this history in an increasingly polarized present. We will read histories of this period and memoirs by movement participants, but our focus will be on engaging in collective archival research and, ultimately curating collections of (8-10) documents that aid us in recuperating these instances of successful coalition building across anti-war, women's and gay liberation, and black power/ethnic nationalist movements, as well as the intersectional politics that informed these collaborative projects. The seminar will meet in Special Collections and will introduce students to the practice of archival research as well as the remarkable range of archival materials housed in Special Collections, which might form the basis for research projects during your four years at Northwestern. Our final class project will be to collectively curate an exhibition of our findings that will be exhibited in the Main Library at the end of Spring Quarter. Over the course of the quarter, we may host a class visitor and, if covid protocols allow, go on a field trip to the Chicago Women's Health Center (established in 1975 and still going strong!) to explore current coalitions and projects that build on this legacy.Cases: Anti-Vietnam war movement; Gay and lesbian/feminist liberation movements in Chicago and at Northwestern; Chicago's first \"Rainbow Coalition\" (which included the Black Panther Party, the Young Lords, and Young Patriots and Rising Up Angry); Chicago's free clinic movement; and reproductive rights/justice projects in Chicago.",

As in many historical contexts, race and gender interacted dynamically and created the particular context of Nazi-occupied Europe, which was a place where Jewish men and women suffered in particular ways, German men and women participated in particular ways, and other racial groups - men and women alike - were targeted, collaborated, resisted and rescued. We will read a variety of texts that explore the influences that shaped the behavior and response of an array of people during the Holocaust. Racism sat directly in the center of the Nazi world view. Once the Nazis got into power, they sought to translate ideology into policy. Still, their racial policies evolved over time, spurred by opportunism, innovation, and war. And too, Jewish men and women responded in ways similar and divergent to the Nazi onslaught. Sexism was also seemingly an important aspect of the Nazi perspective. While they indeed embraced an anti-feminist stance, the Nazis nevertheless sought to incorporate \"German\" women into the national community and women participated actively in the implementation of Nazi racism.",

The terms used to describe gender and sexual minorities in the past and around the world might be unrecognizable to us today - but they have all shaped our current identities. In this course we will be exploring queer histories in a global context to understand the people and experiences behind the categories. Rather than taking a chronological approach, or looking at countries in isolation, we will be focusing on some of the most hotly-debated topics in gender history, LGBT history and queer history: how have the identity categories we understand today developed over time and in different contexts? How have gender and sexual minorities sought to liberate themselves and others, and how have these efforts informed movements around the world today?The central focus of your writing requirements will be your own research paper, on a topic of your choice, engaging directly with primary source materials. We will work on this step by step throughout the quarter, starting with defining a topic and research question, developing a bibliography and research strategy, producing a draft and commenting on each other's efforts, and, lastly, writing and presenting a final paper. The ability to conduct independent research is an extremely valuable skill, enabling you to develop as scholars and engage directly with the topics and questions we will be covering.",

This course explores an emotion that is notoriously difficult to characterize-shame-as it manifests itself in literary and visual media in historical and contemporary culture. During the quarter, we will explore the concept of shame in contexts ranging from sexuality studies (transsexuality, #MeToo), to Black feminist theory (white supremacy), post/neo-colonial discourses (Truth and Reconciliation Committee in South Africa), Holocaust and postcolonial studies (survivor guilt), and inequity (poverty and class struggle). We will discuss a variety of materials, selected from a variety of literary texts (J.M. Coetzee, Franz Kafka, Nella Larsen, Primo Levi, Thomas Mann), essays (phenomenology, philosophy, psychoanalysis, cultural studies), film (Boys Don't Cry, reality T.V.), and excerpts from political commisions (TRC in South Africa). Topics for discussion may include: How do we \"read for\" emotion/render emotion legible? ? What role do identity and identification (gender, race, class, religion, and sexuality) play in shame? Does shame differ from guilt (and why should this matter)? Can shame be political and a social force? Does shame have a history? Is shame a social or a private emotion; a bodily or a psychic reaction? We will pose these and other questions and search for answers to them during the course of the quarter.",

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: LGBTQ Art & Activism in the United States.From the Civil Rights Movement to the AIDS crisis to the legalization of gay marriage, LGBT art and activism have been deeply intertwined.  Queer writers in the U.S. have negotiated ever-shifting priorities and stigmas to represent queer life in literature and media. Yet stories have always been a way to have a voice, to account for oneself and one's community, and to connect to others who share one's experience. LGBTQ literature might be outward facing\u2014representing queerness to a straight audience\u2014or it might face inwards, speaking to a queer community of readers. This class will consider the relationship between sociopolitical movements and the art and literature that were produced from or around them. Focusing on flashpoints in the history of LGBTQ rights and culture in the United States, students will leave this course with a concrete sense of recent history, artistic diversity, and intersectional queer studies. In addition to a core set of literary and historical texts, students will give queer culture presentations on each of the primary periods this class covers. These presentations will provide the opportunity to bring in objects from outside of the class, which will supplement our understanding of queer art and activism.",

In what ways does the eighteenth-century novel\u2014a category only just beginning to define itself during the period\u2014particularly lend itself to modern adaptation?

While the humanities seem to focus on subjectivity and feeling, we see the sciences as objective and fact-based. Yet attending to the history of medicine demands a troubled acknowledgement that medical inquiry both shapes and is itself shaped by cultural assumptions about race and gender. Indeed, critics have pointed time and again to how the seeming impartiality of medical fact reveals biases about which kinds of bodies feel pain and who is prone to certain diseases, distinctions that have been assigned moral and social meaning. In this class, we will read literature about medical encounters in order to investigate how ideas about race and gender shape medical experiences. How do these individual accounts reflect larger structural injustices? What kinds of barriers and assumptions do women and people of color face when they receive treatment? What about people seeking gender affirming care? Beginning with the nineteenth century and moving towards the present day, we will examine the surprising history of how medical knowledge often depended on the exploitation of racialized bodies, grapple with the tangled enmeshment of femininity and illness, and explore how claims about medicalized bodies became a metric for citizenship.",

We use books and other writing technologies to express desire, enjoy our sexuality, and explore and define our gender identities. Likewise, cultural anxieties about sex and gender often center on books, as recent calls to ban texts with queer themes from schools and libraries around the U.S. demonstrate. To make sense of the fascinating, often fraught relationship between sex, gender, and written media, this course focuses on a key period in Anglophone literary and sexual history: the so-called Renaissance, when book production exploded thanks to the printing press and England was rocked by rapid cultural, racial, and religious upheaval. Examining representations of sex and gender in books, manuscripts, maps, printed images, and other textual media from sixteenth- and seventeenth-century England, we will ask: how did different communities share ideas about sex? What could be published in print and what had to stay private? What texts survive today, and why? What distinguishes art from obscenity? In the process of exploring these questions, students will have the opportunity to work hands-on with premodern books.",

What thoughts arise regarding this \"phenomenon\" from our current perspective? Has the literary canon also undergone a \"feminization\" or has it remained male dominated? This course seeks to introduce central, important Hebrew women prose writers and to rethink their place in the historiography of modern Hebrew literature - from Dvora Baron, the first \"mother,\" up to contemporary women writers. Have women writers succeeded in shifting from the margins to the center, or is their presence in the Hebrew canon merely spectral and partial as it had been before? During the course, we will read from the works of important and influential women prose writers, such as Baron, Yehudit Hendel, Amalia Kahana-Carmon, Orly Castel-Bloom, Ronit Matalon, Maya Arad, as well as contemporary writers from the new generation of women writers, such as Hila Amit Abas and Maayan Eitan. We will also read feminist, gender and queer theories that will accompany the literary discussions. While some classes will be solely dedicated to a specific writer, others will explore various writers through a prism of a common theme or a theoretical aspect. In this manner, the course seeks to point to the potential relations and correlations between these authors, which often remain outside of \"strong\" (male) historiographic depictions. By the end of the course, we will try to think of an alternative to the \"strong\" models of historiographic depictions through the recent prism of \"weak theory.\" No previous knowledge of Hebrew, Israel or Judaism is required!

What might a vengeful spirit wandering the city have to do with postcolonial futures? What forms of queer relationality are generated on the verge of environmental collapse and the end of capitalism? This course explores the relationship between gender and space in both the representations and sociocultural histories of film and media in a transnational context. We will begin by tracing the cinema's indispensable role in constituting women's mobility and spectatorship in urban space in the early 20th century Western metropolis, and consider the continued relevance and limitation of this framework for understanding gender and spatiality in contemporary media cultures. Through a series of dwellings, including the housewife's kitchen, the madwoman's attic, the abandoned mall, and the apocalyptic forest, we will interrogate the dynamics of labor and play, quotidian and fantastic, subjectivity and identification by putting questions of gender and sexuality to the intersectional concerns of race, class, and nationality.

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: Imagining the Internet: Fiction, Film, and TheoryMuch recent fiction, film and theory are concerned with representing the internet and the World Wide Web. Sometimes cyberspace is depicted as a continuation of previous media such as television, cinema or telephone, but often it is envisioned as a new frontier. This course will examine the ways in which virtual media appears in cultural discourses. We consider how technological objects and tools participate in shaping elements of our culture that may appear natural, logical, or timeless. Our guiding questions will include the following: In what ways are these narratives shaping collective perceptions of the internet? How have virtual technologies challenged experiences of language, gender, community and identity? We will focus on social networking, gaming, artificial intelligence, and literary and filmic representations of these. Following a Cultural Studies model for inquiry, this course will be project-based and experiential. Your attendance and participation are mandatory. No experience needed, only a willingness to take risks and share work.",

Students will be invited to think about race and gender as co-constitutive (rather than simply and innocently intersectional), and about what might be possible after the interrogation\u2014and possibly dismantling\u2014of masculinity even when affixed to blackness. Overall, our aim in this course is to establish a robust understanding of gender, of racialized gender, of blackness, and of masculinity as a gendered and racialized mode of imposed existence. To examine these topics, we will explore the writing of Richard Wright and Percival Everett, documentaries on manhood, black feminist critiques of masculinity, and transgender perspectives on gender.",

In this course, we'll trace the trope of the double back to the nineteenth-century, when doubles proliferated in popular culture. (Think Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.) We'll use the trope of the double to question the hardening of gender roles and racial categories in the nineteenth-century Atlantic world. Together, we'll identify the distinct modes of masculinity, femininity and domesticity presented by the twinned characters in novels like Charlotte Bront\u00eb's Jane Eyre, Mark Twain's Pudd'nhead Wilson, and Mary Seacole's Wonderful Adventures and ask how they uphold or destabilize ideas about  \"traditional\" masculinity and femininity. Pairing novels from England, the U.S. and the Caribbean with readings by essential feminist critics and historians like Saidiya Hartman, Gayatri Spivak, and Anne McClintock, we'll contemplate how gender and racial categories emerge in ways that are entangled and intertwined. We'll consider what these texts can tell us about the relations between the English metropole, its colonies, and the distant- or deeply intimate and interdependent- bonds between them. Throughout the course, we'll also reflect on what contemporary representations of this world, like Bridgerton, have to say about our current understandings of these categories and how they continue to shape our world today.",

To achieve this goal, we will analyze a variety of sources, including literature, films, and other media by authors and activists concerned with the lives and realities of Chinese women.  We will be joined in this enterprise by guest speakers based in the USA, mainland China, and Taiwan who, in their roles as scholars and activists, will help us navigate questions like: What do Chinese women wish to liberate themselves from, how do they enact this and to what end? In what ways does the problem of gender complicate the ideological advent of modernity in China? How do different technologies of communication and exchange, from the literary journal to cinematic narratives to cyberspace, help and/or hinder activism aimed at fostering gender equality and diversity in China? What connections exist between feminists and gender, sexuality, the body, media, nationhood, and politics?

She is the subject of writing for poets and storytellers, Jews and non-Jews alike, and she is often the setting for many films and TV series that were produced in Israel. Jerusalem is immensely diverse, encompassing ultra-orthodox Jews next to secular Jews, Ashkenazi Jews and Sephardi ones, and Jews and Arabs. In this class we will get a glimpse of these sectors as they are portrayed in literary and visual art. We will read poems by Yehuda Amichai (the poet who lived and died in Jerusalem and wrote about and to Jerusalem throughout his entire life) and a short story that takes place in the Mahane Yehuda's Market and portrays the fragile relationship between the various groups in Jerusalem. We will watch clips from a dance project that brings to life love stories that took place in Jerusalem and we will speak with Miriam Engel, the artist who created this project. We will learn about the complex relationship between Jews and Arabs in Jerusalem, the volatile situations and the unique projects of social organizations that strive to promote understanding and co-existence.

Its religion shaped the spiritual life of Eastern Europe, its culture preserved the ancient Greek literature for us, its flamethrowers  forestalled firearms,  its art prefigured the 20th century avant-guard,  its main cathedral of Istanbul's Hagia Sophia was for 900 years a building with the tallest inner space on Earth.

The region has been central in the circulation of medical knowledge and materials ever since. This course traces upheavals in the history of medicine, from contact to the present. A key angle of inquiry will be to consider how global frameworks help make sense of local practice, and how local knowledge informed transnational, hemispheric, and Atlantic developments in public health and medicine. We will also ask what medical practitioners today stand to learn from a chronologically deep, culturally informed understanding of healing and illness. Topics include pre-Columbian medicine and conceptions of the human body; the \"Columbian Exchange\" of pathogens, animals, and people; the global commodification of American plants and botanical knowledge; Catholic, shamanic, and lay healing frameworks; disease eradication campaigns, including the discovery of the yellow fever vector; and experiments with socialized medicine.",

This is hardly new. For millennia, people have been debating what the future holds. They haven't always been right, of course, but even their mistakes tell us a great deal about the times when they were made. Ironically, studying the future is an excellent way to study the past (and reconsider the present). In this course we will learn about 5,000 years of prognosticators, from Mesopotamian astrologers to today's climate scientists. Along the way we will read sci-fi authors and religious millenarians, socialists and Afro-futurists, eugenicists and risk managers. This course will teach you to better assess predictions of things to come. Come explore the alternative worlds of futures past.",

We will look at different examples in different times and places, such as slavery systems in Greece, Rome, Northeastern Africa and West African kingdoms, to ask: What is slavery, and how did very different societies create the status of the enslaved? And how did enslaved men and women experience, and sometimes resist, their condition? From discussions over the legal status of \"slave\" to the social condition of the enslaved, we will debate the making of a key category of human experience.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course surveys the history of Europe from the High Middle Ages through the early modern period to the Age of Atlantic Revolutions. These centuries changed the course of European and world history. The Renaissance, the Reformations, the Scientific Revolution, and the Enlightenment unfolded at the same time as European empires spread first into the Mediterranean and then across the Atlantic, spurring the growth of global capitalism and the transatlantic slave trade. Political and religious freedoms emerged alongside new forms of persecution, control, and oppression. A divided Europe grew increasingly connected to the rest of the world as commercial goods, people, ideas, and diseases traveled across land and sea. Among the major themes we'll explore are a) how individuals who lived through these tumultuous centuries experienced their changing world and b) how changes in health, disease, and environment - including the Black Death, the Columbian Exchange, and the climactic cooling period known as the Little Ice Age - drove the religious, political, social, and economic upheavals of the late medieval and early modern periods.",

We will use a variety of media, including literature, film, and music, as well as more traditional historical interpretations.

We accomplish these objectives by watching films, telenovelas and TV shows; reading selected works of history, sociology, anthropology, and journalism (film criticism in particular); and using the tools and technologies of digital humanities in a series of individual and collaborative projects. The ultimate goal is to produce together an open-access digital repository on drug history as entertainment in the Americas.",

This course examines forgery as a window onto the cultural values, economies and geography of knowledge of assorted countries in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, exploring frauds such as the evolutionary \"missing link\" of Piltdown Man, the tomb of the last Aztec emperor and the Hitler diaries. These historical detective stories are juxtaposed with social histories to analyze why people go to the trouble of making fakes; why other people buy them; and what their efforts tell us about societies ranging from Imperial China to revolutionary Mexico.",

    "ClassOverview": "For many people, the premodern Islamic world is a fabled Arabian Nights-type place, with princesses, domes, genies, and adventure. Popular depictions such as Aladdin (1992) emphasize perfumed women in harems, bearded sultans in turbans, deserts and palaces, sword and horse. But what was it really like? Using primary sources and scholarly literature, this course analyzes medieval Islamic history from the advent of Islam in the seventh century up to the aftermath of the Mongol conquests of the thirteenth century to understand the political, cultural, and socio-religious contours of the medieval Islamic world. Through the eyes of scholars, travelers, writers, and merchants, we will explore pluralism, mobility, and cosmopolitanism within the Dar al Islam, which stretched from the Atlantic to the South China Sea. We will study the foundations of Islamic belief and praxis, their transformations during the medieval period, and the theological debates that shaped them. In conjunction with political history, we will consider cultural, social, and literary history to illuminate an innovative, rich, and vibrant civilization. And we will interrogate historical narratives about this past and why, now more than ever, the medieval Islamic world needs to be revisited.",

We will study the historical construction and histories of anticolonial movements on many forms of the campus - educational institutions (PWIs, HBCUs, Tribal colleges, boarding schools), military bases, religious institutes, museums, and corporate landholdings. By engaging with Indigenous Studies, Black Studies, Asian American Studies, and Queer theoretical scholarship, we will study how structures of power and possibility are embedded in the landscape. Students will be encouraged to create a research project based on a campus of their choice, producing either a traditional paper, a digital project, a performance, or a public event. Class meetings will center on discussions of texts, films, and other documentary material but will also include trips to sites around Evanston and Chicago, collaborative research sessions, and project workshops.This course is approved for the NAIS Minor.",

    "ClassOverview": "The 1917 February revolution emancipated Jews of the Russian Empire; in 1991, the collapse of communism triggered mass emigration of Jews from the Soviet Union. Based on multi-media power-point presentations, this lecture course illuminates the encounter of Jews as a national minority with the communist state in general and leftist ideology in particular. It explores Jewish responses to communism using archival photos and Soviet propaganda posters, Jewish film, music and art, Yiddish literature and folklore, secret KGB and the USSR communist party documents. The course seeks to answer a number of pertinent questions: Who were Jews living in the USSR between 1917 and 1991? Why were they so remarkably visible among the ruling and elite under Stalin and why did Stalin make them targets of his xenophobic campaign? Why did the communist regime suppress the memorization of the Holocaust in the USSR? Ultimately, what made Russians call the Soviet citizens of Jewish origin \"Jews\" and what makes Americans call former Soviet Jews \"Russians\"? How about \"Ukrainian' Jews?  The course integrates the Soviet Jews into the transformation of the Soviet empire and questions the role of Jews in this process. Explore the political, social, religious, cultural, literary, and artistic aspects of the interaction of the East European Jews with communism.",

    "ClassOverview": "The aim of this seminar is to introduce students to the history and historiography of race and gender during the Holocaust. As in many historical contexts, race and gender interacted dynamically and created the particular context of Nazi-occupied Europe, which was a place where Jewish men and women suffered in particular ways, German men and women participated in particular ways, and other racial groups - men and women alike - were targeted, collaborated, resisted and rescued. We will read a variety of texts that explore the influences that shaped the behavior and response of an array of people during the Holocaust. Racism sat directly in the center of the Nazi world view. Once the Nazis got into power, they sought to translate ideology into policy. Still, their racial policies evolved over time, spurred by opportunism, innovation, and war. And too, Jewish men and women responded in ways similar and divergent to the Nazi onslaught. Sexism was also seemingly an important aspect of the Nazi perspective. While they indeed embraced an anti-feminist stance, the Nazis nevertheless sought to incorporate \"German\" women into the national community and women participated actively in the implementation of Nazi racism.",

    "ClassOverview": "This seminar will focus on the 1947 Partition of British India to understand how this traumatic event has become paradigmatic for colonial India and post-colonial South Asia. The Partition created more than just the two rival nation-states of India and Pakistan from what used to be British India. It also generated a long shadow that continues to define ongoing regional conflicts such as those in Kashmir, continual anxieties about majoritarian and minoritarian identity politics viewed alternately with dread and jubilation in both India and Pakistan, and a persistent desire among South Asian creative artists to make sense of the pain of this violent event. How did the Partition come about? How have scholars, commentators, filmmakers, novelists, creative writers, and those who survived the violence of this event understood and narrativized it? Why does an event that occurred seventy-five years ago loom so large in the collective memory of South Asians today?To address these and other questions, this seminar will be divided into two parts, each based on a selected set of textual and visual materials. Part I will explore the long and complicated historiography of Partition, i.e., how Indian and Pakistani officials, historians, and scholars have written about Partition between the 1950s and contemporary times. Here we will read early accounts explaining how and why the Partition happened, in addition to exploring official narratives of Britain, India, and Pakistan about this event. Part II will focus on how Partition has been remembered beyond scholarly circles by filmmakers, novelists, and documentarians. Here, we will read and view a set of films, novels, and short stories to understand why Partition continues to be a deeply troubling subject for South Asians.",

Ultimately, the course is about the ways in which different historians have understood and interpreted the events that unfolded during this time period. Imagine that you and your classmates are a group of conscientious lawyers examining a case ahead of a trial. In this hypothetical scenario, one party has put forward a case based on a certain narrative of events. Out of concern for its accuracy and plausibility, your task is to determine if, or to what extent, it holds water. The case in question has been put forward by historian Elizabeth Thompson in a recent book dealing with Syria and the Arabs' quest for independence following WWI. We are going to familiarize ourselves with the facts of the case and the case itself. Then we are going to scrutinize the argument, weigh the evidence, consider alternatives, and assess the extent to which the case withstands scrutiny.",

    "ClassOverview": "In 2023, the art of drag has reached a fateful juncture. While drag now enjoys unprecedented levels of mainstream, commercial success, it once again stands at the heart of polarizing political discourses. With five US states introducing bills to regulate and ban drag, and a growing pattern of armed protests against drag events, one might ask: why do cross-dressing acts elicit such extreme responses, and how did we get here?In this course, we will dive into the tumultuous history of drag as an object of heated public debate in the modern era. We will evaluate the different ways in which states, communities, and people responded to drag in different temporal and national contexts, with a focus on Europe and North America. What do these debates teach us about how norms of citizenship, morality, gender, and sexuality were negotiated on and off the stage? What distinguishes drag as an art form, and when and how did it truly begin? Is drag inherently liberatory, radical, and progressive, or actually conformist, oppressive, and misogynist? What is the relationship between drag and social movements? How did the World Wars transform and revolutionize drag? And what do queens and kings have to do with any of this?Using primary and secondary sources, including memoirs, documentaries, and memorabilia, we will explore the significance of drag as an art form and a political subculture.",

    "ClassOverview": "The history of \"imperialism in Asia\" is a global history. It involved virtually all of the European colonial powers: Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands, France, Germany and, of course, Great Britain. The United States joined the club in the nineteenth century and, unlike the rest of the colonized world, a non-Western nation, Japan, participated in this tradition of territorial conquest and cultural hegemony. Paradoxically, the Japanese simultaneously intensified the colonial experience and, by starting the war in the Pacific, inaugurated the process that led to decolonization and the emergence of independent nation states. This seminar will explore this history in its multifaceted dimensions, and students interested in Asian, European, American, and Global history are all welcome. The initial two-thirds of the seminar will be devoted to reading primary and secondary sources relating to colonialism and imperialism in East, Southeast, and South Asia. Naturally we will not be able to explore the topic in all its dimensions in just a few weeks, but we will learn from each other. The latter third of the course will be devoted to the research and writing of a term paper on any topic of your choice relating to the history of imperialism in these regions, whether from the historical perspective of the perpetrators or the victims. The purpose of this exercise is to enable students to write the sort of polished term paper that is not usually possible within the hectic confines of the quarter system. You will be afforded the time and personal attention necessary to write a good paper.",

The terms used to describe gender and sexual minorities in the past and around the world might be unrecognizable to us today - but they have all shaped our current identities. In this course we will be exploring queer histories in a global context to understand the people and experiences behind the categories. Rather than taking a chronological approach, or looking at countries in isolation, we will be focusing on some of the most hotly-debated topics in gender history, LGBT history and queer history: how have the identity categories we understand today developed over time and in different contexts? How have gender and sexual minorities sought to liberate themselves and others, and how have these efforts informed movements around the world today?The central focus of your writing requirements will be your own research paper, on a topic of your choice, engaging directly with primary source materials. We will work on this step by step throughout the quarter, starting with defining a topic and research question, developing a bibliography and research strategy, producing a draft and commenting on each other's efforts, and, lastly, writing and presenting a final paper. The ability to conduct independent research is an extremely valuable skill, enabling you to develop as scholars and engage directly with the topics and questions we will be covering.",

In the fall quarter, the class will meet as a seminar to discuss issues relating to the writing of history, how to organize a thesis, how to evaluate evidence, and the use of primary and secondary sources. In the winter quarter, students will finish researching their thesis and write a first draft. Then in the spring quarter, students will complete their thesis. Throughout the year, students will meet with their thesis advisers and the 398 seminar leader to work on proposals, outlines, and drafts, and to discuss their progress toward completion of their thesis. In order to graduate with honors in history, students must successfully complete their thesis and have it approved. However, it is possible for students to complete the three quarters of this course with respectable grades but not be awarded honors.",

Whatever your specialized interests, you should be familiar with shifting debates over the key questions occupying \"specialists\" in that vast field and its equally vast past. Such questions include biography, gender, political cultures of centralization and heterarchy, urbanization, belonging, technology, slavery, long-distance and trade diasporas, religion, intellectual history, labor, colonialisms, and so forth. If you develop a reading fluency in all methodological approaches used to explore some of those questions you can engage more history, African or otherwise. Methods include archaeology, language and historical linguistics, oral textualities, art history, photography, materiality, and entanglements with other-than-human beings. Each method often involves the analysis and interpretation of written documents. You should develop the habit of considering the interplay of politics and ideologies with academic African history.",

This course is designed for students to identify, trace, and analyze audiovisual productions on the so-called narcos in order to understand: (a) the plot devices and aesthetic mechanisms with which cultural producers have commodified history as entertainment; and (b) the effects of these types of narratives and imageries in the creation of historical understandings regarding one of the most challenging problems of our times. We accomplish these objectives by watching films, telenovelas and TV shows; reading selected works of history, sociology, anthropology, and journalism (film criticism in particular); and using the tools and technologies of digital humanities in a series of individual and collaborative projects. The ultimate goal is to produce together an open-access digital repository on drug history as entertainment in the Americas.",

    "ClassOverview": "Environmental Justice in Modern South AsiaEnvironmental Justice in Modern South Asia is an undergraduate class on the unequal experiences and effects of environmental change in South Asia, drawing primarily on case studies from India. Since at least the early 1990s, rapid economic growth, massive infrastructural projects, democratic transformations and global threats of climate change, have characterized the South Asian region. Such political, economic, and ecological processes come together to worsen the lives and livelihoods of marginalized people typically. They tend to intensify their vulnerability to environmental degradation, with historical structures of inclusion and exclusion profoundly shaping how natural resources are accessed and distributed. While the regional focus is on South Asia, at the heart of this course is a broader concern that environmental questions are always questions of equality and social justice.The class will examine how issues of justice and nature are framed within law and official policy debates, within social movements and right-based struggles, as well as within people's moral imaginations and everyday lives.  The following questions will guide the class:What environmental problems arose in South Asia through accelerated economic development across the  20th century and early 21st century?Who suffered the most, why, and how were they affected, socially, culturally, and materially?What strategies for justice and sustainability emerged?How is environmental justice understood across activists, policymakers, and ordinary people whose lives are most in danger?",

    "ClassOverview": "The 1947 PartitionThis seminar will focus on the 1947 Partition of British India to understand how this traumatic event has become paradigmatic for colonial India and post-colonial South Asia. The Partition created more than just the two rival nation-states of India and Pakistan from what used to be British India. It also generated a long shadow that continues to define ongoing regional conflicts such as those in Kashmir, continual anxieties about majoritarian and minoritarian identity politics viewed alternately with dread and jubilation in both India and Pakistan, and a persistent desire among South Asian creative artists to make sense of the pain of this violent event. How did the Partition come about? How have scholars, commentators, filmmakers, novelists, creative writers, and those who survived the violence of this event understood and narrativized it? Why does an event that occurred seventy-five years ago loom so large in the collective memory of South Asians today? To address these and other questions, this seminar will be divided into two parts, each based on a selected set of textual and visual materials. Part I will explore the long and complicated historiography of Partition, i.e., how Indian and Pakistani officials, historians, and scholars have written about Partition between the 1950s and contemporary times. Here we will read early accounts explaining how and why the Partition happened, in addition to exploring official narratives of Britain, India, and Pakistan about this event. Part II will focus on how Partition has been remembered beyond scholarly circles by filmmakers, novelists, and documentarians. Here, we will read and view a set of films, novels, and short stories to understand why Partition continues to be a deeply troubling subject for South Asians.",

By engaging with Indigenous Studies, Black Studies, Asian American Studies, and Queer theoretical scholarship, we will study how structures of power and possibility are embedded in the landscape. Students will be encouraged to create a research project based on a campus of their choice, producing either a traditional paper, a digital project, a performance, or a public event.

How about \"interesting,\" \"zany,\" \"#oddlysatisfying,\" or -- reaching back into the past -- \"beautiful\" or even \"sublime\"? This course explores questions of aesthetic judgment through a sustained and in-depth reading of literary theorist Sianne Ngai's 2012 book Our Aesthetic Categories: Zany, Cute, Interesting. Along the way we will read selections from authors writing in earlier periods (Kant, Lyotard) and major influences on Ngai (Marx, Cavell). We will also consider more recent and primarily internet-based categories of aesthetic judgment as well as possible alternatives to \"judgment\" (such as when art serves as a prop for self care; or when the term \"aesthetic\" signals a lifestyle, e.g. \"cottage core,\" \"dark academia,\" etc). This course is designed to appeal to students interested in reading and writing at the intersections of literature, art, philosophy, and mass culture in 20th- and 21st-century western cultures. It is also designed as one possible introduction to the broad field of writings often called \"literary theory.\" To ground our discussion we will analyze a variety of works across genres and media, including videogames, literature, and experimental film and video.",

    "ClassOverview": "Wanderlust: Travels in Nineteenth-Century LiteratureIn nineteenth-century Britain, a transportation revolution forever altered how people move through the world. Although spurred in large part by technological innovations such as the advent of railway travel, this revolution also unfolded in the pages of newspapers, novels, and other literary texts. This course will explore how literature shaped meanings and experiences of travel across the nineteenth century. How did Romantic poetry help transform the mundane act of walking into a respected leisure activity (aka \"hiking\")? How did Victorian novels help process the shock of railway travel? How did Black transatlantic writers give voice to diasporic experience within a predominantly white British literary marketplace? These questions will take us through the English countryside, along dark Victorian streets, and across the Atlantic, guided by authors including William and Dorothy Wordsworth, William Hazlitt, Mary Prince, Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, Mary Seacole, and Bram Stoker. While exploring how nineteenth-century authors used representations of travel to grapple with pressing issues of their day, we will also consider the ongoing legacies of these issues in contemporary culture and lived experience. To that end, the course will include several short excursions in the Chicago/Evanston area.",

    "ClassOverview": "Shame! Histories and Culture of an EmotionEmotions are integral to our lives and influence how we navigate the social worlds we inhabit. This course explores an emotion that is notoriously difficult to characterize-shame-as it manifests itself in literary and visual media in history and contemporary culture. During the quarter, we will explore the concept of shame in contexts ranging from sexuality studies (transsexuality, #MeToo), to Black feminist theory (white supremacy), post/neo-colonial discourses (Truth and Reconciliation Committee in South Africa), Holocaust and postcolonial studies (survivor guilt), and inequity (poverty and class struggle). We will discuss a variety of materials, selected from a variety of literary texts (J.M. Coetzee, Franz Kafka, Nella Larsen, Primo Levi, Thomas Mann), essays (phenomenology, philosophy, psychoanalysis, cultural studies), film (Boys Don't Cry, reality T.V.), and excerpts from political commisions (TRC in South Africa). Topics for discussion may include: How do we \"read for\" emotion/render emotion legible? What role do identity and identification (gender, race, class, religion, and sexuality) play in shame? Does shame differ from guilt (and why should this matter)? Can shame be political and a social force? Does shame have a history? Is shame a social or a private emotion; a bodily or a psychic reaction? We will pose these and other questions and search for answers to them during the course of the quarter.",

    "ClassOverview": "Care, Community, Collaboration: Studies in 20th and 21st Century ArtHow do we make community through care and collaboration? When does collective action become art? Taking art's recent \"social turn\" as a starting point, this class will explore how public performance, community organizing, forms of communal care, and mutual aid constitute creative interventions. Put differently, this is a course about creative forms of relationality and relationality as a creative form. Together, we will examine projects at the intersection of artistic practice and political activism, ranging from Fluxus and Womanhouse, to the Black Arts Movement in Chicago, feminist video collectives in Mexico City, and radical pedagogies of teaching artists in Chicago public schools, to contemporary tactical media interventions and large-scale international exhibitions. We will seek to understand how the less visible relationships behind artworks, exhibitions, or community projects themselves might constitute creative practices, while taking seriously the artistic value of interventions that may not look like \"art.\" In doing so, we will collectively investigate art historical theories of social practice and relationality. Accessible readings from interdisciplinary scholars will address themes of artistic collaboration and community action in relation to race, gender, queerness, and indigeneity. Along with participation, evaluation will be based on a short paper, a presentation, and a final project in the form of either a research paper, creative project, or community intervention, designed in discussion with the instructor. Depending on scheduling availability, we will also incorporate artist visits and/or a gallery tour.",

    "ClassOverview": "\"Law and its Discontents: Depictions of Criminality in Literature and Film\" will explore the ways in which the figure of the criminal has been represented across national traditions throughout the 20th and 21st century, with a special focus in the Latin American region. By carefully examining aesthetic depictions of the \"outlaw\" -from the American \"Cowboy\" to the Argentinian \"Gaucho\"- this course will address not only the role that these figures have played in the construction of national identities, but will also explore their potential for unsettling our conceptions of lawfulness, institutional justice, and ultimately, of the nation itself. Thus, in analyzing written and visual cultural practices that revisit the figure of the criminal, this course will explore topics such as the relationship between legal order and violence, criminality and popular justice, as well as of the (out)law and civil society. Primary readings for this course will include works from Roberto Bola\u00f1o, J. L. Borges, Angela Davis, Gabriela Cabez\u00f3n C\u00e1mara, Franz Kafka, and others.",

What is the role of smell or color in shaping ideas of racial difference in contemporary cities? Does public art challenge or reinforce relations of power and domination in urban spaces? This course examines how aesthetic expressions and practices inform and regulate everyday life in cities by constituting physical and symbolic boundaries of belonging and exclusion. Course material will merge prominent theories of urban space and place and political aesthetics to meditate on how urban power relations emerge and are maintained through the intertwining of ideologies, images, and multi-sensory stimuli. We will also examine specific case studies on the role of aesthetics in constituting classed, raced, or gendered boundaries of cities or propelling or weakening liberation movements such as Black Lives Matter, movements for climate justice, and the 2011 Middle East uprisings. By the end of the course, students will be able to critically analyze the aesthetic politics of the urban built environment beyond dominant visual-centric approaches.",

Participants will practice with both analog tools (drawing and collage) and digital tools (Photoshop and Illustrator) and learn to combine analog and digital tools to create static images for telling stories or communicating research. Course will be particularly useful for participants who would like to follow a path in animation, comics-graphic novels, design, photography, or cinematography. This course will also introduce a path for creating comics essays as an alternative to writing academic papers. Participants will keep a journal, make weekly design and drawing assignments, participate in critique sessions, and make an individual presentation about a design work. Final project may include a comics story, storyboard or a comics essay derived from research. No drawing or software skills required for taking this course, but participants must be willing to practice drawing through a range of assignments.",

    "ClassOverview": "Course title: Performance and Power: Gender, Race, and SexualityThis course explores how categories and expressions of gender, race, and sexuality are created, circulated, and contested through performance. Rather than disentangle experiences and representations of gender, race, and sexuality to focus on one category over the others, our analysis will bring these categories to bear on one another as we work to theorize how bodies accrue social meaning that objectifies, stereotypes, appropriates, and maybe even empowers or liberates human subjects to challenge sexism, transphobia, racism, and homophobia. Performance studies is an interdisciplinary field animated by the insights and methods of many disciplines such as theatre studies, anthropology, literary studies, sociology, political science, philosophy, and several others. As a result, it will likely resonate with students in any academic discipline, and no experience with performance is necessary. The course is primarily a seminar-style discussion. By the end of the term, students will have produced an original research project that analyzes some aspect of performance alongside topics of gender, race, and/or sexuality that have a global significance.",

The course will specifically focus on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate change (UNFCCC). In addition, students will design and complete a research project related to a topic, country, or organization of their choice with reference to international climate change politics and policy.

As the flip side of our desire to see, exhibitionism manifests the desire to be seen, to expose oneself to the look of others\u2014to turn oneself into a spectacle\u2014in both the private and public spheres. While drawing from the fields of cinema and media studies, feminist/queer theory, and critical race theory, we will analyze how film, television, and social media both express and construct our desire for visibility. We will pay particular attention to questions of gender, sexuality, and race, and to the ways in which spectacle and politics have joined forces at different junctures in Italian history.",

    "ClassOverview": "Strictly speaking, until the first half of the 20th century, it is difficult to talk about a fashion which is essentially Italian rather than the execution of French-inspired models. It was only starting from the 1950s, with the fashion shows in Sala Bianca in Florence, that Italian fashion was established at the international level. The Fifties were also the decade of the Italian economic miracle, which constitutes both the presupposition and the consequence of a growth in American interest in Italian fashion. In the eighties Italy established fashion as a language of mass culture with the invention of a new pr\u00eat-\u00e0-porter - or \"ready to wear\": a kind of style attractive from an aesthetic point of view and independent from high fashion and from France stylistically and structurally.At the beginning of the 21st century, Italian fashion collects heritage of craftsmanship, taste for beauty, attention to the manufacture of the product, organizational capacity, and production quality, but above all, it launches new ways of representing, selling and communicating the product.The course will start with an introduction to the birth of modern fashion in Europe at the beginning of the 20th century and will then focus on the birth and the development of Italian fashion from 1920 up to 2000, always comparing it with other western fashion styles in France, in the United Kingdom and in the U.S.A.Fashion plays a key role in Italian culture and the study of its diachronic and synchronic development help to understand many aspects of Italian society and its way of lifestyle.",

But Farocki understood Brecht and Godard and extended their work through films (documentary, essay, activist), installations and writings. He also understood contemporary Italian thinkers (Negri, Lazzarato, Virno) and their radical approach to labor, life, and creativity. In an incredibly large and varied body of work produced from the 1960s to the 2010s Farocki addressed two principal subjects: the practices of labor and the production of images. When we experience this work, multiple lines of flight open up. What is an image? How do images shape our subjectivities, our social and political systems?",

Has the literary canon also undergone a \"feminization\" or has it remained male dominated? This course seeks to introduce central, important Hebrew women prose writers and to rethink their place in the historiography of modern Hebrew literature - from Dvora Baron, the first \"mother,\" up to contemporary women writers. Have women writers succeeded in shifting from the margins to the center, or is their presence in the Hebrew canon merely spectral and partial as it had been before? During the course, we will read from the works of important and influential women prose writers, such as Baron, Yehudit Hendel, Amalia Kahana-Carmon, Orly Castel-Bloom, Ronit Matalon, Maya Arad, as well as contemporary writers from the new generation of women writers, such as Hila Amit Abas and Maayan Eitan. We will also read feminist, gender and queer theories that will accompany the literary discussions. While some classes will be solely dedicated to a specific writer, others will explore various writers through a prism of a common theme or a theoretical aspect. In this manner, the course seeks to point to the potential relations and correlations between these authors, which often remain outside of \"strong\" (male) historiographic depictions. By the end of the course, we will try to think of an alternative to the \"strong\" models of historiographic depictions through the recent prism of \"weak theory.\" No previous knowledge of Hebrew, Israel or Judaism is required!

According to prevalent assumption inside and outside academia, the relationship between Jews and Arabs in those years was solely characterized by mutual rivalry, violence, and conflict. This course, however, aims to challenge this belief by looking at diverse interactions that went beyond the political rivalry between the two communities. Relying on a 'History from Below' approach, we will examine shared identities and common experiences and discuss a wide range of daily encounters and collaborations that took place between ordinary Jews and Arabs in different public spheres such as mixed cities, education system, business and labor market, political organizations, leisure venues and more. Using primary historical sources, we will analyze the myriad ways in which Jews and Arabs formed personal and even romantic relationships in the background of the escalating national struggle",

    "ClassOverview": "Since its inception, Israeli society is comprised of various and different social groups; immigrants, Arabs, Jews, foreign workers, religious people, secular people, ultra-orthodox Jews, Christians, to name several. In a society where many feel themselves as outsiders, what does Otherness actually mean? Is it a subjective stance or a definite (and \"objective\") position? Does Otherness exist only when juxtaposed with what is supposedly the social norms of \"Israeli society\" or can it stand by itself? Does Israeli society is othering others to have a false sense of unity? And is there an actual entity of \"Israeli society\" or is it only imagined by those who seek to be part of it? Film in its nature is an introspective tool, and in the case of Israeli film it has always been a prism through which Israeli directors examine questions of identity, the treatment of \"others\", and the relationship between the center and the margins. In this class we will watch various Israeli films that relate to the notion of otherness and to the dilemmas that arise from the characters' complex position in Israeli society. Among the movies we will watch are \"Noodle\", \"Borrowed Identity\", \"Sandstorm\" and \"Baba Joon\". We will read texts that will contextualize the movies and will shed light on the stance of otherness in Israeli society. No previous knowledge of Hebrew or Israel or Israeli cinema is required.

The course will investigate historical dimensions of water in Israel and the Middle East, focusing on ancient civilizations and the water infrastructures that are essential tools in aiding the development of water-poor societies. We will use this historical context as a stepping-stone to transition into a more recent history of the Middle East, focusing on the challenges that the nascent state of Israel faced following the influx of millions of immigrants. We will then examine efforts to develop the necessary water resources needed to support the burgeoning population as well as the irrigation projects designed to convert barren desert land into cultivated agriculture. This more recent history will help to set the stage for discussions regarding geopolitical conflicts over land and water that continue to this day. We will evaluate regional climate and water in the context of current and future geopolitical conflicts, reviewing recent advances in water technologies spurred by these limitations as well as the potential development of combined social and technological solutions for long-term water sustainability in Israel and the Middle East. We will end the course with discussions regarding opportunities for global translation of innovative water technologies and water-management solutions developed in Israel to other water-poor regions. In addition, the course will host a symposium featuring international experts. It will explore how water access and control contributes to trans-boundary politics and how recent advances in Israeli water technologies may serve as a model for sustainable water development in other water-poor regions of the world.",

    "ClassOverview": "The growth of the Latino population has transformed the United States and has led to heightened debates about their political power, cultural influence, citizenship, civil rights, and ethnic and racial categorization. Yet as the 2020 election demonstrated, many Americans still don't really understand who Latinos are\u2014or who Latinos have been, and will become. While the increased attention to Latinos may feel \"new,\" Latino communities have played a pivotal role in U.S. history for centuries. In this course, we will explore the 500-year history of Latinos in the United States\u2014and, indeed, across the Americas\u2014from the 16th century through the early 21st century. In its broadest sense, Latino History offers a reinterpretation of United States history that focuses on race, migration, labor, and empire. It is also the history of a community\u2014or several communities, including Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, Dominican Americans, Central Americans, and Cuban Americans, and others\u2014that represents a growing percentage of the U.S. population as a whole, and one that will increasingly influence the politics, social life, culture, and economy of the United States. Although we will focus on the United States, we also will examine the movement of Latino peoples within and between the United States, Latin America, and the Caribbean. We will use a variety of media, including literature, film, and music, as well as more traditional historical interpretations. Ultimately, you will gain a deeper understanding of the issues and histories that bring Latinos together, those that continue to divide them, their multiple and shifting racial classification, and the long struggles for equality and belonging that have animated their histories.",

We will begin by studying Chicano and Nuyorican literary texts from the 1960s and 1970s and will conclude with work by newer voices Justin Torres, Carmen Maria Machado, and Xochitl Gonz\u00e1lez. Our readings will represent various literary genres, voices, and discourses that exemplify the various styles of writing created by a diverse group of national, ethnic, racial, and gendered subjects. We will emphasize historical continuities since the 1960s and 70s, while also exploring the relationship between genres and emerging social issues.

To guide pedagogical practice and curricular goals in Latinx Studies and performance studies, we will use the concept of \"historian as curandera [healer]\" The concept \u2014 coined by scholar Aurora Levins-Morales \u2014 challenges us to engage critical inquiries when exploring untold or unrepresented Latinx hi/stories. Students will grapple with questions and directives, such as, \"How does positionality affect what one sees/understands? What constitutes evidence? How do historical narratives transform when we center the marginalized? Asking questions are as important as answering them.\" This concept is an important pedagogical tool to disrupt harmful narratives and stereotypes that pathologize Latinx communities.

The course will focus substantively on the use of state violence and civil penalties in contexts of war, families, and corporations, including the university. The jurisprudence of U.S. statutory interpretation will be explored through analysis of debates about the implementation of national security and sexual harassment policies. The theoretical frameworks of Walter Benjamin, Friedrich Hayek, Franz Kafka, Carl Schmitt, Hans Kelsen, H.L.A. Hart, Lon Fuller, Jacques Derrida, Catherine MacKinnon, Max Weber, and Janet Halley will be compared for their usefulness in understanding the interpretation of contemporary laws and imagining alternatives.This class introduces students to the primary texts, theories, and techniques necessary for grasping the rule of law in the United States today. The objective is to improve basic legal literacy in the context of larger questions of political and legal theory. Skills student learn include legal research using online databases, including LexisUni, and Proquest Congressional research databases, as well as how to understand the U.S. Code and Code of Federal Regulations. Students learn these skills in the context of reflecting on larger principles of statutory interpretation -- does a law mean what the plain text says, what Congress \"intends,\" or a \"purpose\" imputed to law by judges?Please note that there are no formal prerequisites, but students who have not had previous classes in political theory may find this class challenging. POLI_SCI 201 or equivalent would be helpful.POLI_SCI 309-0 and LEGAL_ST 309-0 are taught together; may not receive credit for both courses.",

At the same time, many animals benefit from legal protections that we do not grant to a rock or a robot. How did we develop our patchwork system of protections over animals? How do we determine which animals are protected and which are left as unambiguous \"things\"? And is there any way to regulate a nonhuman animal as something other than property? In this course, we will survey the legal status of nonhuman animals in US law, both for domesticated (livestock and companionate) and wild animals.  Our aim will be to develop a practical, rather than an idealized, understanding of the US's patchwork of regulation regarding how nonhuman animals can and cannot be treated.  Readings will include federal and state caselaw and statutes as well as secondary legal and historical analyses.Pre-requisites: Legal_St 206-0 or Poli_Sci 230-0, or instructor approval.",

Many of us watch these shows to relax, to turn off our critical thinking, and to immerse ourselves wholly into some manufactured drama and schadenfreude.  Considered as a cultural text, though, reality television can illuminate some profound truths: about how we decide what is right and wrong, about the tension between written and unwritten rules, and whether anyone can simply be \"here to make friends.\"In this course, we ask what reality TV can teach us about the nature of law.  We'll read and discuss key works in the philosophy of law from H.L.A. Hart, Lon Fuller, Ronald Dworkin, Scott Shapiro, and others, and then see how their ideas stand up to the test of shows like Survivor, The Bachelor, FBoy Island, Ink Master, and Bachelor in Paradise.  By the end of the quarter, students will be able to explain the main currents of thought in legal philosophy with reference to elimination ceremonies, confessionals, alliances, and other fundamentals of reality TV gameplay.",

Meanwhile, those who land law jobs have different challenges: recent surveys report many attorneys' growing disenchantment with their work and dissatisfaction with their lives. This seminar will examine the profession's multidimensional crisis. What changes occur in attorneys, both individually and systemically, emerging from law schools and finding their roles in the legal realm? Why is working within the most lucrative big firms now regarded by many as the pinnacle of private practice? What other options are available? It will explore life after law school, examining the disparate places law graduates might find themselves. The course invites prospective law students to consider their potential places, as individual lawyers, in what remains a noble profession. It also invites those students in other undergraduate disciplines who may be curious about trajectories open to them in this post-graduate academic and, ultimately, career field.",

We approach this difficult question by investigating what speakers know about how meaning is conveyed in language, including the distinction between what expressions literally mean, and the different shades of meaning that expressions can take on in different contexts of use. In carrying out this study, we plumb the linguist's toolkit (which includes tools borrowed from mathematics, logic, language acquisition, and experimental psychology) to discover how language scientists determine what a given word or sentence means, and whether that word or sentence means the same thing across occasions of use. This inquiry will lead the student to an understanding of the scientific study of language, by examining how it plays out in the domain of linguistic meaning. By the end of the course, students will have gained a deeper appreciation for one of the most important, yet still most elusive, aspects of the human capacity for language.",

Along the way, we will introduce fundamental concepts like the p-adic numbers, quadratic reciprocity, and the Riemann zeta function and prove other number theoretic results such as Lagrange's four-square theorem and Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions. Other topics can be covered depending on student interests (for example, we could go further with analytic methods).Prerequisites: Math 331-3. No previous experience with number theory is assumed.",

We will study neural circuits and behavior using mutant analysis, neuroanatomical techniques, and behavioral paradigms such as courtship, aggression, and circadian and sleep behavior. We will use the fruit fly as a model system because of the amazing genetic tools available to study the fly nervous system and the conservation of basic neurobiological processes between flies and humans. During the first section of the course you will learn a variety of techniques through assigned projects. You will then design a project using the techniques learned in class, to be completed in the final weeks of the course. This will be summarized in a lab report due during finals week.NOTE 1:This course requires manual dexterity, steady hands, and good vision. You will need to handle flies while keeping them healthy, dissect their brain tissue, and troubleshoot practical problems. If any of these might pose extraordinary challenges for you, please talk to the instructor before registering.NOTE 2: You will need to come into the labs outside class time at least a few times a week to collect virgin flies. This is done at the beginning (before 9:15 am) and the end of the day and it is an ongoing task. Later in the course you likely also will need to come to finish experiments. Time outside regularly scheduled class is typically 2 or more hours per week, scheduled to our mutual convenience, and motivated students often elect to spend more time. Prerequisites: NEUROSCI 202-0 and NEUROSCI 206-0; or NEUROSCI 311-0 and NEUROSCI 206-0; or BIOL SCI 302-0.",

What does it really mean to be a woman or a man -- and are these categories we'r e born into or categories that we become or inhabit through living in a particular way under specific conditions? Human history all the way up to the present seems to be rife with asymmetrical relations of power that relegate those marked out as women to a subordinate position -- what explains this? What would it mean to over turn this state of affairs -- and which strategies are most likely to accomplish this task? And to what extent is it possible to grapple with all of the above questions -- questions of gender, sex and sexuality -- without also, at the very same time, thinking about how they relate to questions of class and race?

For example, do sentient non-human animals like pigs or polar bears have moral standing? What about non-sentient life, such as plants or fungus? Might whole ecosystems or even nature as such have moral standards? We will examine recent arguments on these questions and their implications for moral theory.  In the second part of the course, we will turn directly to the issue of global climate change. We will explore the standard economic analysis of climate change as a collective action problem and the philosophical presuppositions of that analysis. We will consider the question of the fair distribution of the benefits and burdens of climate mitigation globally, and we will discuss the ethics of geoengineering. We will close by considering the issue of \"anthropocentrism\" in ethics, asking whether and why anthropocentrism might be a problem for moral theory.",

    "ClassOverview": "(Jeong Eun Annabel\u202fWe and Penelope Deutsher, 2022-2023)A revolutionary, thinker, psychiatrist, and physician, Frantz Fanon (1925-1961) produced a diverse\u202fand groundbreaking life work from Martinique to Algeria that has shaped generations of activists and scholars, and continues to do so.This graduate seminar will examine early and late major writings of Fanon, and a selection of scholarship on and influenced by Fanon in the fields of critical race theory, feminist theory, and decolonial thought, such as Gordon, Karera, Maldonado-Torres, Zambrana, Mbembe, Al-Saji, Snorton, and Wynter, among others. The range and nature of responses to Fanon's work since his time speaks to the continued problem of colonialism, anti-Blackness, and the racialized gender system, as well as the changes in paradigms and discourse surrounding these issues. The course encourages seminar participants to think critically with and about Fanon's work, to incorporate Fanon into their research and explore the renewed significance of Fanon's work today.",

Why have some countries witnessed repeated industrial transformations, whereas others have economies that remain significantly non-industrial and agricultural?  When and how did certain countries \"get ahead\" of others in the global economy?  To what extent can less-developed countries \"catch up\" with more developed ones?  How does \"globalization\" affect these chances?  These are some of the questions that we will explore in this class.  The goal of the seminar is to enhance our understanding of differences in levels of development among countries of the world, and to explore competing hypotheses designed to explain those differences.  We will examine both the contemporary global economy and the historical processes that brought the current situation into being.",

With the conceptual help of these fields, we will explore issues like state sovereignty, globalization, ecological sustainability, economic development, nationalism, international security, nuclear proliferation, and human rights. The design of this class aims to apply international relations theories to the actors, interests, and ideas that shape global politics. The trick with a survey core course is to find a balance between \u2018classic' texts and current events. Thus, this class will provide you both a strong foundation for understanding international politics and skills to apply that foundation to common international politics issues. With readings on topics such as colonialism, lived experience during war, impacts of international organizations and law, ways of exercising state sovereignty, etc., the course is especially attentive to the centrality of race, gender, sexuality, socioeconomic class, and nationality to global interactions.",

    "ClassOverview": "(Subject to change)The phrase \"rule of law\" conveys a range of expectations we have of government and each other. Is the rule of law a meaningful aspiration for a legal system that is fair and ensures everyone, including government officials are equally accountable? Or is the phrase a cynical ruse on behalf of the powerful to control wealth, territory, and populations? This course will explore the origins of the rule of law in European political thought and compare selected theorists' descriptions of the relation between law and politics. The course will focus substantively on the use of state violence and civil penalties in contexts of war, families, and corporations, including the university. The jurisprudence of U.S. statutory interpretation will be explored through analysis of debates about the implementation of national security and sexual harassment policies. The theoretical frameworks of Walter Benjamin, Friedrich Hayek, Franz Kafka, Carl Schmitt, Hans Kelsen, H.L.A. Hart, Lon Fuller, Jacques Derrida, Catherine MacKinnon, Max Weber, and Janet Halley will be compared for their usefulness in understanding the interpretation of contemporary laws and imagining alternatives.This class introduces students to the primary texts, theories, and techniques necessary for grasping the rule of law in the United States today. The objective is to improve basic legal literacy in the context of larger questions of political and legal theory. Skills student learn include legal research using online databases, including LexisUni, and Proquest Congressional research databases, as well as how to understand the U.S. Code and Code of Federal Regulations. Students learn these skills in the context of reflecting on larger principles of statutory interpretation -- does a law mean what the plain text says, what Congress \"intends,\" or a \"purpose\" imputed to law by judges?Students must be prepared to discuss readings and respond to instructor queries during class meetings. Mandatory first class attendance.Please note that there are no formal prerequisites, but students who have not had previous classes in political theory may find this class challenging.

Collective action problems are pervasive in negotiations and attempts to address, monitor, and enforce international environmental agreements are often weak. Yet, despite these constraints, international actors have designed and secured agreement in a variety of policy arenas, aiming to improve global environmental governance. Through a team-based approach to learning, we will explore how, why, and when the international community is able to overcome collective action problems and effectively address global environmental challenges.The course is divided into three parts. In the first part of the course, we will focus on the problems, institutions, and politics in global environmental governance. The second part of the course focuses on key concepts or themes in global environmental politics that shape our understanding of international cooperation in solving environmental problems, such as science, justice, markets, and security. In the third part of the course, students will participate in an extended negotiation simulation to examine the diverse actors and modes of engagement that define the politics around a particular issue.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course is an introduction to politics in contemporary sub-Saharan Africa. The core questionsframing the course are: What is African about African politics? How do colonial legacy and international political economy shape African states? How is politics practiced on the continent? What explains Africa's uneven economic trajectories and diverse patterns of conflicts? How toexplain the large variation within Africa in the strength of the state, the levels of economic growth and respect for democratic institutions? What role identities (ethnic, religious and class) play out in politics? What are the current dilemmas and questions in African politics? The course is organized around the following themes: the formation of the state in Africa; the practice of power, regime types and forms of government, the role of religion, identity and politics; the challenges of development and the economic dimensions of African politics; authoritarianism and democratic experiments; violence, terror, and security; Africa in world politics. While the course is not designed as a study of individual countries, in exploring the themes and trends that dominate politics across Africa, we draw on case studies from a variety of countries on the continent.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course is about violent domestic political conflicts. By the 1970s wars within states, referred to in this class as civil wars, had become the world's dominant form of warfare. These conflicts are notable for their intensities and their durations. Elements of civil wars also appeared in inter-state wars, such as after the American-led attack on Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq in 2003 and against the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2001. These wars have involved armed struggles between state forces and rebels over the control of territory and the right to form the central government. But armed actors in civil wars reflect many agendas and include ethnic militias, vigilante groups, foreign mercenaries, and criminal gangs. A key observation in this course, however, is that these multiple agendas and complex dynamics\u00bf\"wars within wars\"\u00bfplay more important roles in recent and ongoing civil wars. This development stands in contrast to civil wars through the mid-20th century. Though these wars also included complex arrays of armed groups and agenda, they tended to feature more clear-cut distinctions between state and rebel combatants. The causes and significance of this change will constitute one of the themes of this course.The first segment of this course will consider several academic theories about the causes of civil wars. These theories range from the economist's analysis that an abundance of natural resources and other economic opportunities provide incentives for rebellion to enterprising individuals, to the idea derived from international relations that \"security dilemmas\" (mutual fears that one's neighbors are preparing to strike) cause civil wars, and to the investigation of how changes in the global structure of economies and politics are at the roots of many civil wars. The second segment of this course will focus on the processes of war fighting in civil wars. Students will find that the explanations of causes of civil wars, while of varying applicability from one case to the next, prove to be quite valuable in terms of generating questions and in turning attention to particular kinds of relationships. This section will focus on processes such as the rise of leaders, the formulation of ideologies and political programs (or their absence), and recruitment of fighters and supporters.

    "ClassOverview": "Special Topics: Integrity and the Politics of CorruptionIf all seasoned politicians in a fragile democracy are implicated in wide-scale corruption, but if the country is facing an acute economic crisis requiring experience at the helm, what ought to be done about the corrupt, and who ought to decide? What compromises, if any, are appropriate when considering kleptocrats who are effectively holding their people hostage - for instance, rulers who systematically abuse loans from foreign creditors, but who rely on the fact that their vulnerable population will suffer if loans are cut off entirely? What compromises, if any, are morally appropriate when dealing with dictators who threaten to unleash violence unless they are guaranteed an amnesty by the democratic forces trying to replace them? This upper-level course delves into such fraught political problems, revolving around different kinds of corruption and abuse of political power. In order to grapple with these problems, we examine in detail two moral ideas related to \"the people.\" The first is the idea of the sovereign people as the owner of public property, often stolen by corrupt politicians. The second is the idea of the people as an agent with its own moral integrity - an integrity that might bear on intricate policy dilemmas surrounding the proper response to corruption. In the process of examining both of these ideas, students will acquire familiarity with prominent philosophical treatments of integrity, property, and - more generally - public policy.",

    "ClassOverview": "The emergence of Muslim politics is arguably one of the defining transformations of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. This course explores the diversity of the contemporary political experiences of Muslims in multiple and shifting contexts to address questions such as: what is the role of ideology and faith in Muslim politics? Where does political Islam come from? How does politics play out in the lives of Muslims? How diverse are contemporary political experiences of Muslims? How did immigration, globalization, Islamic revival and violent extremism and securitization policies reshape the political and religious landscape of Muslim-majority nations as well as in non-Muslim countries?  What does the study of political Islam teach us about the relationship between religious and politics in the modern world?The course is divided in three parts. In Part 1, we focus on the politics of Islamic revival through the trajectories of various Islamic political movements in the Middle East, Asia and Africa to understand the origins of the rise of political Islam and its national, regional and global impact.  In Part 2, we turn to transnational Muslim networks and connections to explore the main issues around global political Islam in its various forms including violent Islamic extremism, Sufism, piety movements, economic networks. We discuss also anti-Muslim violence and its origins. In Part 3, we examine the social, political and historical dynamics shaping the politics of Muslim minorities in Europe and the USA, including the war on terror, identity politics, racialization and islamophobia.Our cross-cutting themes include state in the Muslim world, party politics, secularism, democracy, social movements, political violence, the politics of religion, security policies, globalization, citizenship, social and economic development\u2026Our readings are drawn from political science, religious studies and anthropology.",

    "ClassOverview": "This graduate-level seminar will explore the conditions and processes shaping social and political mobilization. We will examine major theories from the fields of sociology and political science about social movements: collective challenges to authority that aim to change society or institute structural changes in an existing state or states. We will consider competing explanations of the emergence of collective action, the conditions under which people do or do not rebel, various aspects of the strategic interaction between social movements and states, the sources of movement strategy, and the determinants of movement outcomes. We will read theoretical works and case studies on a range of social movements in both democratic and nondemocratic state settings. This examination of major analytical debates, as well as varied empirical material, aim to give students a solid foundation on which to build their own research projects.",

This seminar looks at diverse approaches to the concept of international order and maps the idea's intellectual terrain.

    "ClassOverview": "Describing his upbringing as a child of Eastern European immigrants, the Jewish Brazilian novelist Moacyr Scliar (1937-2011) once said, \"At home, you speak Yiddish, eat gefilte fish and celebrate Shabbat. But in the streets, you have soccer, samba, and Portuguese. After a while you feel like a centaur.\" Scliar's fictional explorations of Jewish identity have led the literary scholar Nelson Vieira to observe that the Brazilian writer's stories \"are reminiscent of work by Canadian-Jewish writer Mordecai Richler and the American novelist Philip Roth, both of whom struggle to capture the perplexing and exasperating paradoxes of people who live between two worlds.\" This course will take Vieira's remark as a critical point of departure to read contemporary Jewish literature of the Americas comparatively. Building on critical/theoretical readings, we will explore selected post-WWII novels and short stories published by Jewish writers across North and South America. While such fiction is often framed solely as part of a national tradition, we will look beyond national borders to understand some of the convergences and divergences of Jewish literary discourses which have emerged in different national contexts of the Western Hemisphere. Over the term, we will examine ways in which modern and contemporary Jewish fiction writers have approached themes of religion, culture, assimilation, diaspora, race, gender, sexuality, the legacy of the Holocaust, and other key concerns.

Overall, the goal of this course is to impart an initial understanding of some fundamentals of human nature and behavior, as well as instill a deeper appreciation for the science of psychology. To this end, several hours of laboratory experience participation are required across the quarter to allow you to have firsthand experience of the way research is conducted in psychology. Alternatively, a paper (requiring roughly the same number of hours outside of class) reviewing primary research articles in psychology may be substituted for the laboratory experience.

We will begin with an overview of the model and its theoretical underpinning and will then delve into the nuts and bolts of how CBT is implemented, from the first session through termination. We will learn about variants of CBT (e.g., mindfulness, DBT, ACT), as well as the way that CBT is applied to different types of psychological problems or disorders. Class will consist of a combination of lecture and discussion, including frequent case examples. We may have a guest lecture from another practicing psychologist, and you will definitely learn to consider real applications from the field. You will also read research about CBT and will develop a research proposal for a study or conduct a literature review on a CBT-related topic of your choice.",

    "ClassOverview": "If people did not possess some basic concern for the welfare of others, it would not be possible to develop or sustain the complex societies in which we currently live. However, within these societies, individuals, groups, and corporations often encounter a wide variety of opportunities and temptations to pursue their own personal goals, aspirations and achievements at the expense of the larger social good. What then determines when people will resist versus give into these temptations? Where do people's concerns for others come from in the first place, and what types of experiences nurture versus suppress these concerns? In this course we will explore such questions by reviewing research on prosocial behavior performed by economists, evolutionary biologists, and social psychologists. Furthermore, the primary objective of this course is to not only teach you about when and why people choose to act prosocially, but to also have you experience first-hand the obstacles and rewards that such choices entail.",

Among the specific topics we may cover are: distinction between science and pseudoscience, science denial, superstition, parapsychology, conspiracy theories, ghosts, near-death and out-of-body experiences, witchcraft, alien abduction, and repressed memories of abuse.Since this is an upper-level research course, we will focus on psychological theories, methodological issues, and empirical research in this area.

Whether informed by religious revelation, collective trauma, or individual creativity, these visions provide important vantage points for assessing cultural values and experiences. In this class we will explore religious models of \"The Afterlife\" while also analyzing afterlives constructed in fiction, film, art, and other forms of popular media. We will ask how envisioning other worlds can help us to alternately articulate and blur the boundaries between life and death, trauma and healing, past and present, and reality and fiction. We will also explore what it means to \"live after\" major ruptures in individual and collective experience. For instance, how do we envision life after pandemic? After climate change? Revolution? Immigration? Utopia? Through speculative fiction, how to we envision the afterlives of humanity as we assess the potential for a post-human world?Sources will include ghost stories from around the world, medieval visions of hell, purgatory, and heaven, videos of dead celebrities resurrected as holograms, episodes of Upload, The Good Place, and Star Trek, contemporary news releases, and short speculative fiction. Students will develop skills in analytical writing, creative thinking, and classroom collaboration.",

The course content highlights a variety of themes, issues, figures, and narratives, while examining diverse religious practices, productions, communities, representations and identities. In this course, we dive into one of today's most exciting and rapidly growing areas of scholarship - the intriguing intersections and complex entanglements of religion and media in popular culture. Drawing from a diverse array of interdisciplinary sources, we will explore what media studies and communication theories have to offer the study of religion, and reciprocally how religious studies scholarship might enrich media studies. Our primary sources are drawn from such areas as religious television, film, and radio, digital gaming worlds, billboards, advertisements and media campaigns, popular music, comedy, streaming video, social media, memes, and even tattoos, body art, and graffiti. We will look at such areas as: how religion gets mediated; the religious dimensions of transmedia storytelling and media world-building; religion as communication; online group identity formation and religious identity construction; media representation of religions; the blurred boundaries between the so-called \"sacred and the secular\" in the study of religion and media; and controversies in overlapping religious worlds and media worlds vis-\u00e0-vis the authorized and unauthorized circulation of content. Of particular interest in this course will be the impact of digital culture on the media-religion interface. Students will be asked to research and analyze a primary source of their choice and then to make their own media to communicate their original analysis and research findings. This course will involve your own creative mediamaking. Please note format: This course is a mixture of lecture and in-class participatory discussion.

We will use historical methodologies to explore the complex networks of religious practices, cultural ideologies, and political actors that influenced its production. We will also consider how the New Testament has been read and reproduced in the past 2000 years. We will discuss a range of theological perspectives, analyze the impact of the New Testament on art and literature, and assess its role in global politics.

What metaphors and parables have Buddhists used to convey these insights over the centuries? Students will be able to explore these and other questions through a selection of English translations of original texts in Sanskrit, Pali, Chinese, and Tibetan including the life of the Buddha, his sayings, Buddhist sutras, and Buddhist autobiographies.

How have sacred spaces shaped American Judaism, and how has American Judaism contributed to the formation of American sacred space? We will map the topography of American Jewish sacred spaces, both literal and conceptual, and we will consider the effects of American laws, practices, and norms on Jewish communities. As a central component of the course, students will craft their own \"site biography,\" acquiring first-hand experience conducting ethnographic and historical research.

It ends with the rise of anticolonial resistance and the formation of proto-Islamist movements in the early twentieth century.",

The study of ethics (also known as moral philosophy) pursues answers to these questions, providing tools for thinking clearly and deliberately about moral life. Moral life is frequently a concern of literature as well. Like ethics, literature focuses on the quality of choices people make, their grounds for doing so, and the consequences that follow. In this class, we will read classic works of Russian literature that foreground decision making\u2014its bases, execution, and consequences\u2014together with some foundational ethical theories. Keeping the fundamental distinctions between literature and ethics in mind, we will explore what might be gained by comparing literary and philosophical reflections on challenging ethical situations.",

It will look at the factors leading to the USSR's disintegration and resulting ethnic conflicts, the security issues requiring responses from the U.S., and the decision-making processes in responding to these challenges.The disintegration of the Soviet Union was the twentieth century's last in a series of collapses of multinational empires, and it presented the U.S. with the most difficult security challenges.   In the immediate aftermath, U.S. policy makers were faced with not one but four nuclear powers (Russian Federation, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Belarus), thousands of under-secured nuclear weapons and under-paid nuclear scientists, and several armed secessionist conflicts in the Caucasus and Moldova.The collapse of the USSR meant the end of an uneasy, but by and large consensual, international security system. Russia has shown a willingness to reject that consensus. It has rejected Western support for the democratic aspirations of former Soviet states, willing even to use military force to deny countries like Ukraine and Georgia their sovereign rights to join NATO and the EU. Closer to home, it has employed various direct and indirect efforts to undermine Western solidarity and confidence in the liberal democratic system.\"",

This seminar explores the tension between the social emphasis on identity (naming who we are and claiming where we belong) and the technological processes of identification (distinguishing people for administrative purposes). Using texts primarily from the social and historical sciences, we will pivot back and forth between considering the many kinds of identity currently in circulation (racial, ethnic, gender, and sexual identities; illnesses identities; political identities; etc.) and the rise of techniques and technologies that seek to identify people and fix them in place (from the invention of surnames, to the rise of forensic techniques such as fingerprinting, to the creation of the \"average\" person in opinion research, to the role of DNA testing in telling us who we are). The object of the course is to better understand the historical and social circumstances that determine where people fit\u2014how they know themselves and are known\u2014and to trace the diverse cultural and political implications of identity and identification.",

During the span of this quarter, we will learn about the role of food in society, how social norms as well as culture impact our view of food and review the following topic within food and society: Food inequality, food and sustainability, food and gender and lastly, food culture in the US. We will do so by employing a sociological perspective to food that will help is critically engage with something we do every day - preparing and eating food. This is an introductory level class and does not require prior knowledge in sociology or in knowledge production. By the end of the quarter students will view food as a social and community construct that impacts our lives, well-being, and society.This course is taught with ENVR_POL 211-0-20",

The course will provide students with a set of research tools with which to conduct research on legal institutions.   The course builds on content from Legal Studies 206/Sociology 206, a prerequisite for this course. While part of the Legal Studies major sequence, the course will enrich the analytic skills of students from many fields who are interested in law or in interdisciplinary research methods.Prerequisite: LEGAL_ST 206/SOCIOL 206.Taught with LEGAL_ST 207; may not receive credit for both courses.The topical focus of the course will be violence by the police and capital punishment in the United States.  These topics will be explored with interdisciplinary readings and relevant legal cases.  Students will be exposed to several research tools and research processes, as they also engage with material on police violence and capital punishment.  In addition to shorter assignments, students will develop a small research project and write a research paper on a topic of their choosing.",

What these events share is their potential to disrupt communities, displace residents, and cause economic, emotional, and social suffering. We know that disasters are on the rise globally and in the US, incurring significant economic and social consequences. The aim of this course is to understand how disasters like pandemics, hurricanes, floods, wildfires, plane crashes, oil spills, and terrorism provide a \"strategic research site\" where we can examine social life and inequality. In this course, students will be introduced to the idea that disasters are fundamentally social events. We will focus on the social, political, and economic conditions that influence disaster experience and recovery, paying special attention to the ways that social characteristics like race, class, gender, and age structure social vulnerability to risk before, during, and after disasters. In learning to think critically about prevailing media representations of disasters, students will master content analysis methodology by engaging in a term-long research project in which they study one recent disaster event and the associated media coverage.

Why were lockdowns used a measure against COVID-19? What are the causes of state-formation and revolution? And how much power do \"the elites\" really have?

    "ClassOverview": "\"Theories of Race and Ethnicity\"For years we have understood that race is, biologically speaking, an exceedingly complex matter and that preconceived biases much more than biology govern the way people think about race.  In this course, we will discuss both the biological myth and social reality of race.   Specifically, this course provides an overview of the prominent theories/theorists of race and  ethnicity, and is concerned with: 1) Understanding the early science of race used to justify racial classification and thinking, 2) reviewing the theories regarding the nature and persistence of  race and ethnicity as meaningful social groupings in society, and 3) explaining the social  significance of these group identities (e.g., how they are related to social stratification,  social-cultural relations, and the political and economic dynamics in society).We will begin our review with the origins of the concept race, then move from early perspectives to the present in an aim to understand the influential theories and theorists.  As we proceed in our investigation we will continuously ask: 1) What are the key assumptions, propositions and concepts  of each theory?, 2) How is the theory located within the larger theoretical tradition? 3) Does this theory agree or disagree with other views in the field? 4) What is the level of empirical support  for the theory? 5) To what extent does the theory help to explain contemporary patterns of race and ethnicity across time and space in the United States? and 6) How might one undermine systems of racial inequality if the respective theory is holds?\"",

At the same time, it will show how that field has been redefined and reinvigorated by science and technology studies. We will seek to understand health, health care, and biomedicine by exploring multiple domains: the work sites in which health professionals interact with one another, with their tools, and with their clients; the research settings where medical knowledge and technologies are generated; the cultural arenas within which ideas of health and disease circulate; the market relations that produce health care as a commodity; the institutions and practices that transform social inequalities into health disparities; the social movements that challenge the authority of experts; and the bodies and selves that experience and are remade by illness.

    "ClassOverview": "What is testimonial narrative and how are we supposed to read it? Should we read testimonial texts as historical documents? Or as literary texts? Or as both? And what about testimonial cinema? Does that category refer only to documentary film? Or can feature films also be read, as it were, as testimonial narrative? What's the difference between one way of reading or seeing and the other? What do we expect--or even demand--by reading one way or the other? As it turns out, these are the sorts of questions that Latin American testimonial narrative--which has been among the most prominent (and also controversial) currents in Latin America since the \"post-Boom\" era--urges us to pose, even if we can't come up with definitive answers. Moreover, the testimonial genre pushes us to think more broadly--that is, about how we understand the term \"literature\"; how we think about \"the author\"; how we read texts or view films as \"telling the truth\" (or not); and more. Together, we will consider such questions and concepts in our reading/viewing of well-known works representing different models of testimonial narrative: Rigoberta Mench\u00fa's Me llamo Rigoberta Mench\u00fa y asi me naci\u00f3 la conciencia (1983), presents a first-person account of the indigenous human-rights activist's story and struggles; Jacobo Timerman's Preso sin nombre, celda sin n\u00famero (1981), offers the author's account of his imprisonment during Argentina's military dictatorship; Gast\u00f3n Biraben's Cautiva (2004; feature film), dramatizes how the daughter of Argentine desaparecidos uncovers her true identity; Patricio Guzman's Nostalgia de la luz (2010; documentary), juxtaposes astronomers searching the skies for the origins of the universe and Chilean citizens searching the earth for the remains of their family members in the post-Pinochet years. Secondary historical and critical materials, as well as discussion of testimonial concepts and terms, will help us to frame and analyze our primary materials. Reading & discussion mainly in Spanish.

In this course we will approach modern and contemporary issues regarding border and migration in the Americas from a literary and visual culture standpoint. We will draw from authors like Gloria Anzald\u00faa, Valeria Luiselli, and Yuri Herrrera. Although we will focus mainly on the experience of the US-Mexico border, our hemispheric approach will help us to address some of the contemporary border issues in Central and South America.

    "ClassOverview": "Medieval Sepharad: Language, History and Memory of the Jewish Communities of Medieval IberiaThis course provides a broad introduction to the legacies and histories of medieval Spanish Jewish communities, from their late Roman origins through their eventual conversion and expulsion in the 15th century, and their subsequent global diaspora during the early modern period. It follows a mixed chronological and thematic approach, allowing students to think comparatively in historical, literary or philosophical terms about the Iberian Jewish tradition. It will invite students to reflect on how we study pre-modern Jewish communities, and more broadly minority groups in medieval Spain and the Mediterranean basin, and address questions of agency, visibility, textuality or identity of these groups. The course will challenge students' understanding of what is distinctively \u2018Spanish', \u2018Jewish', or \u2018Medieval' about these collectives. It will also discuss the legacy of Jewish culture and philosophy in Spain, and historiographical models that underpin the study of these groups, especially the rise of anti-Judaism, and the impact of neo-lachrymose accounts of the Iberian past in Jewish studies.

Why is theatre the genre that has most prolifically discoursed with this phenomenon and what problematics does that present? What types of migrants appear on stage? How do these plays allow us to understand a changing Spain? Students will read a variety of plays and theoretical texts in order to answer these questions.
